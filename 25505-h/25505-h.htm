<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><span class="smcap">The</span> sunlight falls in gold upon the golden fields,</span><br />
The ruffling wave gives back the sky in blue;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The asters fringe the meadow's skirts in purple pride,</span><br />
And proud the goldenrod is standing, too.<br />

And oh, I fondly think of them that's far away.<br />

Oh, green the trees that blossom o'er their head!<br />

And on their hearth the fire-glow warm and red!<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still may they hear, across the lonely water,</span><br />
The wild bird call his mate at close of day;<br />

Still may they kindly think of them that's far away!<br /></div>

<h2>THE MERRYWEATHERS</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE ARRIVAL</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Oh</span>, Peggy, I am afraid!"</p>

<p>"Why, Margaret!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. I feel very shy and queer,
going among strangers. You see, I have
never really been away in my life; never
in this way, I mean. I was always with
father; and then&mdash;afterward&mdash;I went to
Fernley; and though so many people have
come into my life, dear, delightful people,
I have never somehow gone into theirs.
And now, to go into a whole great big
family, only two of whom&mdash;I mean which&mdash;oh,
dear me! I don't know what I mean,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
but I have only seen two of them, you know,
and it is formidable, you will admit, Peggy."</p>

<p>"Well, I feel just a scrap queer myself,"
said Peggy; "but I never thought you would.
And anyhow, we needn't; we both know the
boys so well, and though you have not actually
seen the Snowy, you really know her
very well. Darling thing! Oh, I cannot
wait till we get there! Do you think we
ever <i>shall</i> get there, Margaret? This is the
longest journey I ever made in my life."</p>

<p>"How about the journey from Ohio?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is different. I know all the
places along the road, and they slip by before
one can think. Besides, a long journey always
seems shorter, because you know it is
long. Well, you needn't laugh, you know
perfectly well what I mean. Oh, Margaret,
I saw a glimpse of blue behind the trees.
Do you suppose that is the lake? do you
think we are nearly there? Oh! I am so excited!
Is my hat on straight?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret Montfort, by way of reply,
straightened her cousin's hat, and then proceeded
to administer sundry coaxing pats
to her hair and her ribbons.</p>

<p>"You are a trifle flyaway, dear!" she said.
"There! now, when you have taken the black
smut off your nose, you will be as trim as possible.
Am I all right?"</p>

<p>"You!" said Peggy, with a despairing
look, as she rubbed away at her nose; "as
if you ever had a pin or an eyelash out of
place! Margaret, how <i>do</i> you do it? Why
does dust avoid you, and cling to me as if I
were its last refuge? How do you make your
collar stay like that? I don't see why I was
born a Misfit Puzzle. Oh&mdash;ee! there <i>is</i> the
lake! just look, how blue it is! Oh! Margaret,
I <i>must</i> scream!"</p>

<p>"You must <i>not</i> scream!" said Margaret
with quiet decision, pulling Peggy down into
the seat beside her. "You must be good,
and sit still. See! that old gentleman is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
watching us, Peggy. He will be scandalized
if you carry on so."</p>

<p>"He doesn't look a bit scandalized; he
looks awfully jolly."</p>

<p>"Peggy!"</p>

<p>"Well, he does, Margaret. Do you suppose
Mr. Merryweather is anything like that?
<i>Margaret!</i>"</p>

<p>"What is it, Peggy? <i>please</i> don't speak so
loud!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it <i>is</i> Mr. Merryweather. I think&mdash;I
am almost perfectly sure it must be.
Why, he is positively staring at us. It <i>must</i>
be Mr. Merryweather!"</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Merryweather specially addicted
to staring? I should not suppose so. This
gentleman is not in the least my idea of
Mr. Merryweather; and if he does stare,&mdash;there!
he is looking away now,&mdash;it is because
he sees a great big girl dancing and
jumping in her seat as if she were Polly
Peppercorn."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Next station Merryweather!" chanted the
brakeman.</p>

<p>"There! Margaret, he is getting his things
together. It is! it <i>is</i>, I tell you. Oh! I
<i>shall</i> scream!"</p>

<p>Peggy's threat was uttered in so loud a
stage whisper, that Margaret looked up in
alarm, fearing that the gentleman must have
heard. She met a glance so kind, so twinkling
with sympathetic merriment, that she
smiled in spite of herself.</p>

<p>The gentleman lifted his hat, instantly,
and stepped forward. He was not tall, but
broad and muscular, with keen, dark eyes
that sparkled under shaggy white eyebrows;
a most vigorous, positive-looking old gentleman.</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons!" he said, in a
deep, gruff voice which was the very essence
of heartiness. "You also are getting off at
Merryweather, young ladies? I beg the privilege
of assisting you with your parcels; I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
insist upon it! Permit me, madam!" and
he took possession of Margaret's travelling-bag,
Margaret blushing and protesting, while
Peggy's blue eyes grew to absolute circles,
and her little mouth opened to another.</p>

<p>"You are very kind!" said Margaret.
"Indeed, I can carry it perfectly&mdash;thank
you so very much! Yes, we are going to
Mr. Merryweather's camp. Do you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Harry Monmouth!" exclaimed the old
gentleman. "Astonishing! Going there myself.
Permit me to introduce myself&mdash;Colonel
Ferrers, at your service."</p>

<p>He lifted his hat again, and bowed low.</p>

<p>"Our name is Montfort," said Margaret
timidly, attracted and yet alarmed by his
explosive utterance, so different from the
quiet speech of the Montfort men.</p>

<p>"Not John's daughters!" cried the
Colonel. "I'll be shot if you are John's
daughters!"</p>

<p>"Oh! no," cried Margaret, her eyes lightening.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
"Not his daughters, but his nieces.
Do you know Uncle John, Colonel Ferrers?"</p>

<p>"Know John Montfort? know the nose on
my face? not that there is any resemblance;
fine-looking man. I have known John Montfort,
my dear young ladies, ever since he was
in petticoats. John, Dick, Jim, Roger&mdash;fine
lads! used to stay at Roseholme&mdash;my place
in Dutchess County&mdash;forty years ago. School-boys
when I was in college. All over the
place, climbing, hunting, fishing, falling off
the roofs&mdash;great boys! haven't heard of
them for twenty years. Where are they
now? all living, I&mdash;eh, what?"</p>

<p>"My father, Roger Montfort, is dead," said
Margaret, softly; "so is Uncle Richard. Uncle
John and Uncle James are living, Colonel
Ferrers; this is Uncle James's daughter.
Peggy dear, Colonel Ferrers! and I live with
Uncle John at Fernley House. Oh! how
delightful to meet some one who knows Uncle
John!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pleasure is mine, I assure you!" said the
Colonel, gallantly. "Harry Monmouth! takes
me back forty years. Knew Roger, your
father, well, Miss Montfort. Great scholar;
fine fellow! nose in his books all day long,
just like my brother Raymond; great chums,
Roger and Raymond. I remember once&mdash;ha!
here we are!"</p>

<p>"Merryweather!" shouted the brakeman.
The train drew up beside a little wayside
station. On one side of the track, a platform
and a shed, with a few barrels and boxes
lying about; on the other, a long stretch of
dark blue water, ruffling into brown where
the wind swept it.</p>

<p>The three travellers, emerging, found three
persons awaiting them on the platform.
Gerald Merryweather was first, his hand on
the rail, his face alight with joy and eagerness;
close beside him was another person, a
tall girl in gray, at sight of whom Peggy,
who had been apparently stricken dumb by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
aspect of Colonel Ferrers, shouted aloud and
tumbled off the car-step, to the imminent peril
of life and limb.</p>

<p>"Snowy! Snowy! is it really you?"</p>

<p>"You dear Peggy!" cried Gertrude Merryweather,
taking her in her arms, and giving
her a hearty kiss. "I am <i>so</i> glad! and this
is Margaret&mdash;oh! welcome, most welcome,
to Merryweather! Dear Colonel Ferrers, how
do you do? it was so good of you to come!
But where is Hugh? haven't you brought
him?"</p>

<p>Colonel Ferrers drew her a step aside.</p>

<p>"My dear Gertrude," he said, in a confidential
tone, "there is no need of my
telling <i>you</i> that Hugh is one of the most
astonishing&mdash;I will say <i>the</i> most astonishing
boy I ever saw in my life. Expected to come;
looking forward to it for weeks, greatest
pleasure of the summer. Yesterday morning,
Elizabeth Beadle had an attack of lumbago;
painful thing; confined to her bed; excellent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
woman, none better in the world. Never
could understand why good people should have
lumbago; excellent complaint for scoundrels;
excellent! well, the boy&mdash;his great-aunt, you
understand!&mdash;refuses to leave her. Says she
likes to have him read to her! Preposterous!
I insisted, Elizabeth Beadle insisted, with tears
in her eyes; tears, sir! I mean my dear! Boy
immovable; Gibraltar vacillating beside him;
tottering, sir, on its foundations. I had to come
away and leave him, perfectly happy, reading
Tennyson to Elizabeth Beadle. Ask somebody
else to coerce a boy like that; Thomas Ferrers
is not the man for it. Where's my Cochin
China Chittagong?"</p>

<p>"Jack?" said Gertrude, laughing. "He is
behind the shed, with the horses. The old
horse doesn't like the train, and will not stand
tying. As soon as Jerry gets the trunks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Checks?" cried the Colonel, in answer
to Gerald's request. "Two of them, sir. Sole-leather
trunk, green carpet-bag. Anything for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
me by express? box, hamper, basket, that sort
of thing, eh, what?"</p>

<p>"I should think there was, sir!" said
Gerald. "A basket of peaches as big as the
camp, or very near it; and a hamper that
says 'salmon!' as plainly as if it could speak.
You're awfully good, sir!"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort!" retorted the Colonel.
"Pity if I can't have a little gratification
once in a way. Ah! there is my Cochin
China&mdash;how are you, sir, how are you?
prancing, as usual, like an Egyptian war-horse.
Come here, and be introduced to the Miss
Montforts! We are in luck, sir! Miss Montfort,
Miss&mdash;eh? thank you! Miss Peggy
Montfort, my nephew, John Ferrers. Here
sir! take the bags, will you? Which way,
Gerald? eh? what?"</p>

<p>While the colonel was explaining (and exploding)
to Gerald and Gertrude, and Margaret
looking and listening in quiet amusement,
Peggy had been hanging back, overcome in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
her turn by the shyness which her companion
had conquered. But now Gertrude
took her by the hand, and while the trunks
were being hoisted on the wagon by Gerald
and Jack, aided by a tall and powerful lad in
blue overalls, the two walked up and down
the little platform in earnest talk. Fragments
of it reached Margaret where she stood,
as they passed and repassed.</p>

<p>"Yes, last week. She is very well, she
says, and fluffier than ever, on account of the
heat. She has enjoyed her school very much.
She wanted Grace to join her, and I think
she might have, if all this had not come about.
Oh, Peggy, I was so glad!"</p>

<p>"Blissful, my dear, is no word for it! they
have no eyes for any one else. He can't remember
that there is any one else, and she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I always said that if Grace did care
for any one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, in October. The wedding is to be
at Fernley, and&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anybody coming with me?" inquired
Gerald, wistfully. "Margaret, will you risk
life and limb with me and the old horse?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure!" said Margaret. "Is he
very wild? He doesn't look so."</p>

<p>"Only by comparison with the young
horse!" said Gerald. "Jacob, don't strain
your back lifting that carpet-bag!"</p>

<p>Jacob, the youth in blue overalls, smiled
calmly, and swung a large trunk over his
shoulder as if it were a hand-satchel.</p>

<p>"It's you I'm scared about, Gerald," he
said slowly; "fear you'll do yourself a hurt
pulling on the reins. Frank hasn't been out
since yesterday."</p>

<p>"I'll risk him!" said Gerald. "Now,
Margaret." He held out his hand, and Margaret
stepped lightly up to the seat of the
Concord wagon.</p>

<p>"Now," said Gerald, "Jack, if you'll
drive the beach-wagon&mdash;is that all right,
Toots?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly!" said Gertrude. "Peggy, you
and I will sit together behind; that is, if you
do not mind the front seat, Colonel Ferrers?
So! all right now, Jack! we'd better let the
old horse go first, for he doesn't like to stay
behind the new one. Oh! Jacob! how are
you going home? we must make room for
you somewhere."</p>

<p>"I'll go across lots," said the blue youth,
"and be there to take the horses when you
get there. You better hurry them up the
least mite, so's I sha'n't have to wait too
long!"</p>

<p>With a benign smile he vaulted over a five-barred
gate, and went with a long, leisurely
stride across the fields.</p>

<p>"He'll run when he gets round the corner!"
said Gerald. "I know that's the way
he does it. Get up, Frank! do <i>play</i> you
are alive, just for once. Oh, Margaret, I am
so glad to see you. I thought September
would never come. It has been the longest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
summer I ever knew. Haven't you found
it so?"</p>

<p>"Why, no!" said truthful Margaret. "It
has seemed very short to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, of course it has been short too,
summers always are; like the dachshund!"</p>

<p>"The dachshund!" repeated Margaret.
"What can a dachshund have to do with
summer, Gerald?"</p>

<p>"A description I once heard," said Gerald.
"I was walking with Beppo, my dachs, and a
little boy stopped to look at him. 'Ain't he
long?' he said. 'My! ain't he short?' Even
so summer. Oh, I <i>am</i> glad to see you. Get
up, Frank!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE CAMP</h3>



<p><span class="smcap">A long</span>, low, irregular building, with a wide
verandah in front, the lake rippling and ruffling
almost up to the piers; beyond, great
hills rolling up and away. To right and left,
boat-houses and tents; hammocks swung between
the trees, fishing-rods ranged along the
sides of the building. This was the Camp.
As the wagons drove up, Mrs. Merryweather
hurried from the house, and Mr. Merryweather
and Phil came up with long strides from the
wharf. Amid a chorus of eager welcome, a
babel of questions and answers, the travellers
were helped out and escorted to the verandah.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/gs02.jpg" width="500" height="344" alt="&quot;&#39;HERE IS YOURS,&#39; SAID BELL; &#39;NEXT TO OURS.&#39;&quot;" title="&quot;&#39;HERE IS YOURS,&#39; SAID BELL; &#39;NEXT TO OURS.&#39;&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;HERE IS YOURS,&#39; SAID BELL; &#39;NEXT TO OURS.&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Most welcome, all!" cried Mrs. Merryweather.
"Are you very tired? No? that is
good! Well, but you must be hungry, I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
sure. There are doughnuts and milk on the
table; or if you would rather have tea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are not hungry, Miranda!" said
Mr. Merryweather. "They cannot be hungry
at three o'clock. Dined at Wayport, Ferrers?
Of course! Jack, show your uncle his tent!
Miss Montfort&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll show them the way, Papa!" said
Gertrude. "Where is Bell, Mammy? Oh,
there she is! Bell, here are Margaret and
Peggy; girls, this is Bell!"</p>

<p>Bell Merryweather, a sturdy, blue-eyed girl
with the general aspect of a snow apple,
greeted the guests with a hearty shake of a
powerful hand, and a cordial smile.</p>

<p>"We have been looking forward so to your
coming!" she said. "Don't you want to come
out to your tent? Here, I'll take your bag,
Margaret; shall I say 'Margaret' at once?
it will be so much nicer. This way!"</p>

<p>She led the way, Margaret following,
Gertrude and Peggy after them, still talking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
eagerly. A row of flagstones led past
the boat-house, and on under solemn pines
and feathery birches to where a line of tents
stood facing the water.</p>

<p>"Here is yours," said Bell; "next to ours,
this big one; we are three, you see. Yours
is small, but I hope you can be comfortable."</p>

<p>"Comfortable!" echoed Peggy; "I should
think so! Oh, Margaret, do look! how perfect
everything is! Oh, what ducky beds! the red
blankets are just like home; our boys have
red blankets. Oh, I shall be perfectly happy
here!"</p>

<p>Margaret, accustomed to the wide spaces
and ample closets of Fernley House, was a
little bewildered at the first glance around
her. The tent was hardly bigger than the
stateroom of a moderate-sized steamer. Could
two persons live here in anything approaching
comfort? A second glance showed her how
compactly and conveniently everything was
arranged. The narrow cots, with their scarlet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
blankets and blue check pillows, stood on
either side; between them was a table, with
blotter of birch bark, and an inkstand made by
hollowing out a quaintly shaped piece of wood
and sinking in the hollow a small glass tumbler.
Above the head of each bed hung a long
shoe-bag with many pockets, while opposite
the foot were rows of hooks for dresses, a shelf
on which stood pitcher, basin, etc., and a chest
of drawers. All was fresh, neat, and tidy.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure we shall be happy!" said
Margaret, repeating Peggy's words.</p>

<p>"Here is the hook for your lantern," said
Bell. "Here is a little jar for crackers, but
be sure to keep it covered, or the squirrels
will carry them off. I hope you will not
mind a squirrel coming in now and then?
they are so tame, they come hopping in to
see if we have anything for them; I often
leave a bit of something."</p>

<p>"Oh! what fun!" said Peggy. "I love
to tame squirrels. Ours at home will come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and eat from our hands. Will yours do
that?"</p>

<p>"Not often; at least, not for me. The
boys can bring them sometimes. I think they
like boys best. But I have a dear little field-mouse
who brings me her babies to look at
now and then, just to show me how they are
growing. There, now, we go on chattering,
when I know you ought to rest awhile, and
unpack and stow away. It takes quite a bit
of planning for two persons to fit into a tent.
By and by, when you are all settled, would
you like to go out on the water? Hurrah!
we'll come for you. Come on, Toots!"</p>

<p>The two sisters walked slowly down the
long slip that led to the floating wharf, and
sat down with their feet hanging over the
edge.</p>

<p>"Well, Bell!" said Gertrude, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Bell, slowly.</p>

<p>"What do you think of them? Isn't she
lovely? and isn't Peggy a dear?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Bell. "I think you have
just hit it, Toots. Peggy is a dear; just a
hearty, jolly dear; but Margaret is lovely.
Do you see a little hint of Hilda? I can't
tell where it is; not in the features, certainly,
nor in the coloring. I think it is in the
brow and eyes; a kind of noble look; I don't
know how else to put it. You wouldn't say
anything false or base to this girl, any more
than you would to Hilda; you wouldn't dare.
My lamb! I speak as if falseness and baseness
were the usual note of your conversation."</p>

<p>"I thought you were a trifle severe," said
Gertrude, smiling. "Well, anyhow, it is a joy
to have them here, and dear Colonel Ferrers,
too. What shall we do this evening? Here
come the boys for a council."</p>

<p>The twins, Gerald and Phil, came running
down the wharf, followed by Jack Ferrers.
The latter, whom some of my readers may
have known as an awkward, "leggy" boy, was
now a man. Very tall, towering three or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
four inches above the six-foot Merryweathers,
he still kept his boyish slenderness and spring,
though the awkward angles were somehow
softened away. He no longer stooped and
shambled, but held his head up and his
shoulders back; and if he did still prance,
as his uncle declared, like the Mighty Ones of
Scripture, it was not an ungraceful prancing.
Briefly, Jack Ferrers was a fine-looking
fellow.</p>

<p>"Council of War?" asked Gerald; "or
do we intrude?"</p>

<p>"Sit down!" said Bell. "We were just
beginning to plan the evening. What are
your ideas, if any?"</p>

<p>The boys&mdash;for they were still the boys,
even if they had passed one and twenty&mdash;stretched
themselves along the wharf in
picturesque attitudes.</p>

<p>"I would sing!" announced Gerald.
"Prose will not express my feelings at this
juncture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

"My fertile brain is simmering,<br />

</div>

<p>"Your turn, Ferguson. Go on; the song

</div>

<p>"Oh! no, Phil," said Gertrude. "Not
the very first night the girls are here; it will
take them a day or two to get used to camp
ways, Margaret at least; and we want to do
something all together, something that Colonel
Ferrers will like, too. I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sing it! sing it!" cried Gerald. "The
song upraise, Tintinnabula! no escape!
'Trimmering' is still left you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is there only one vowel?" demanded Bell,
laughing. "I refuse to be fettered. Wait

<div class='poem'>
"Forbear, forbear your clamoring,<br />

<div class='unindent'>Your turn, Toots!"</div>

<p>"I cannot!" said Gertrude. "You know
I cannot, Bell. Besides, there aren't any more
rhymes."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Gerald, "you know what
you are telling, and you know what happens
to people who tell them. Perpend, Tootsina!</p>

<div class='poem'>
"You yodel, yodel yammering,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We know you're only shammering."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Gracious!" said Gertrude. "Don't you
suppose I would make rhymes if I could? It's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
really a dreadful thing to be the only prose
member of a large family. But Jack comforts
me; you can't make them either, can
you, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Not to save my life!" said Jack. "Never
could see how they do it."</p>

<p>"But you can set them to music!" said
Gertrude. "That is the delightful thing
about you."</p>

<p>"And you can illustrate them! That is
one of the many delightful things about
you!" said Jack, with a low bow.</p>

"'They built it up for forty miles,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With mutual bows and pleasing smiles!'"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>quoted Gerald. "A truce to this badinage!
Compliment, unless paid to myself, wearies
me. We go, then, in canoes?"</div>

<p>"In canoes!" replied the others in chorus.</p>

<p>"'Tis well! Any special stunts in the way
of arrangement?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Jack, "in plain prose&mdash;Bell,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
will you come with me? It's our turn to get
supper, isn't it? and I have an idea&mdash;just a
little one&mdash;which we can talk over while we

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">'Twill be the last, at worst!</span><br />

<div class='unindent'>Nay! nay!" he went on, as Jack seized him
by the shoulders, and made a motion toward
the water.</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Duck not the bard, the tuneful bard,<br />

</div>

<p>"False construction!" said Bell. "You
cannot dry squeals."</p>

<p>"They were tearful ones!" Gerald protested.
"It was the tears I would have dried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Tears, idle tears, I know not whence they
come; tears from the depth of some despairing
fiddler."</p>

<p>"Suppose you dry <i>up!</i>" said Jack, dipping
Gerald's head lightly in the water.</p>

<p>"No ducking between swims!" proclaimed
Phil. "Law of the Medes and Persians!"</p>

<p>"Besides, it is time to be making the fire!"
said Bell, rising. "Leave him to his conscience,
Jack, and come along!"</p>

<p>"Yes, leave me to me conscience!" said
Gerald.</p>

Gertrude, a few minutes later, when Phil had
followed the others to the house, leaving the

"Has the rhyming spider bitten you?
you are really wild!"</p>

<p>"Nice little sister!" said Gerald, rolling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
over, and resting his head on Gertrude's knee.
"Nice little red-haired, cream-colored, comfortable

you, Toots, who knows? As it is&mdash;but still I
am happy, my child, happy! I say! Toots!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>AUF DAS WASSER ZU SINGEN</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Harry Monmouth</span>!" said Colonel Ferrers.
"This is pleasant. Merryweather, you are a
lucky dog!" As he spoke, he looked around
him, and repeated, "A lucky dog, sir!"</p>

<p>The horn had just blown for supper, three
long blasts, and already the campers were in
their places at the long table, with its shining
white cover. Mr. and Mrs. Merryweather,
their six children, Bell, Gertrude, and Kitty,
Gerald, Philip, and Willy, the two Montforts,
with the Colonel and his nephew, made a
party of twelve, and filled the table comfortably,
though there was still room for more.
The room was a long one, with a vast open
fireplace stretching half across one side. At
one end were rows of book-shelves, filled to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
overflowing; at the other, the walls were
adorned with models for boats, sketches in
water-color and pen and ink, birds' nests, curious
fungi, and all manner of odds and ends.
It was certainly a cheerful room, and so Miles
Merryweather thought, as his eyes followed
the Colonel's.</p>

<p>"We like it!" he said, simply. "It suits
us, the place and the life. It's good for young
and old both, to get away from hurry and
bustle, and live for a time the natural
life."</p>

<p>"Nature, sir!" said the Colonel. "Nature!
that's it; nothing like it! When I was a lad,
young men were sent abroad, after their school
or college course; the grand tour, Paris, Vienna,
that sort of thing: very good thing in
its way, too, monstrous good thing. But
before he sees the world, sir, a lad should
know how to live, as you say, the natural
life. Ought to know what a tree is when he
sees it; upon my soul, he ought. Now my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
milksop&mdash;best fellow in the world, I give
you my word, except that little fellow at
home there&mdash;well, sir! when he came to me,
he didn't know the difference between an oak
and an elm, give you my word he didn't.
Remember one day&mdash;he heard me giving
directions to Giuseppe about cutting some
ashes&mdash;clump of them in the field below the
house, needed thinning out&mdash;and he wanted
to know how ashes could be cut; thought I
meant those in the fireplace, sir. Monstrous!
Well, I taught him a little, and you and your
young folks have taught him a great deal.
H'm! I don't know that he is now more disgracefully
ignorant than nine-tenths of the
young men of his age. Set of noodles! I'll
tell you what, Merryweather! You ought to
have a kind of summer school here: get other
boys, a dozen, two dozen; teach 'em to see
with their eyes, and all the rest of it. I
knew a boy once who thought a bat was a
bird, give you my word I did. And another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
who thought oysters grew on bushes. Get up
a school, sir, and I'll come myself, and be a
boy again."</p>

<p>"That is a great inducement," said Mr.
Merryweather, laughing: "but, Colonel, I
hope you have brought a boy's appetite
with you, at least. Who are the cooks to-night,
Miranda? Oh, I see; Bell and Jack.
Well, that is all right, Colonel; they make
one of our best combinations. What have
you there, Jack?"</p>

<p>Jack, in a white cap, and an apron reaching
not quite half-way to his knees, advanced
bearing a mighty dish, from which rose fragrant
steam.</p>

<p>"H'm! ha!" said the Colonel, sniffing.
"Smells good! you had no hand in this, I'll
be bound, sir!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Colonel Ferrers," said Bell, who
followed with the teapot and a plate piled
high with feathery rolls, "it is all Jack's
doing, every bit. It is his famous pilaff, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the old Greek professor taught him to make
in Germany; and it is almost the best thing
you ever tasted in your life."</p>

<p>"H'm!" said the Colonel, frowning heavily,
and looking immensely pleased. "So this is
what he was doing while he was supposed to
be studying. I always knew the rascal was
deceiving me. Ha! it <i>is</i> good; it's uncommon
good! So you did learn something besides
fiddling, eh, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Cooking is a part of chemistry, Uncle,"
said Jack, soberly; "a very important part.
This dish is chemically prepared, sir; please
regard it as a demonstration!"</p>

<p>"And please try my fried potatoes as a
further demonstration!" said Bell. "Margaret,
you are not eating anything."</p>

<p>"She never does!" said Peggy.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Margaret, "but I never ate
so much before. Oh, please not!" as Phil
tried to heap her plate with potatoes. "They
are delicious, but I really cannot!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can!" said Gertrude, holding out her
plate.</p>

<p>"I'll warrant you!" said Phil. "No one
doubted that, sweet Chuck!"</p>

<p>"We do not look for the Camp Appetite till
after twenty-four hours," said Mrs. Merryweather.
"Give Margaret time! in two days
she will eat twice as much as she does now."</p>

<p>"Harry Monmouth!" exclaimed the Colonel.
"At that rate, it is fortunate for you
all that I do not outstay my two days. Twice
as much as I am eating now would clear your
larder, dear madam. Yes, thanks, Merryweather,
a little more!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Colonel Ferrers!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Tom! you are not going away
in two days? We counted on a week at least!"
cried all in chorus.</p>

<p>"Impossible, dear people, impossible! Like
nothing better; enchanted to stay all summer;
delightful place. But&mdash;Elizabeth Beadle's
condition, you understand; and the boy&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
must get back. He is too young to have the
responsibility. Most amazing boy in the
world; I haven't the slightest doubt that
he is doing her more good than all the doctors
in the world&mdash;parcel of fools, mostly&mdash;but
still he is too young; I must get back."</p>

<p>"Let me go, Uncle!" said Jack.</p>

<p>"Or me, Colonel Ferrers!" cried Gertrude.
"Any one of us would love to go!"</p>

<p>The Colonel beamed on them with his kindliest
smile, but shook his head resolutely.
"Thanks! thanks!" he said, heartily. "Good
children! kind and thoughtful children! but
I must go. Couldn't be easy, you understand."</p>

<p>"The fact is," said Jack, "Uncle Tom
cannot be comfortable for more than twenty-four
hours away from Hugh. After that
length of time he becomes restive, and symptoms
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'develope'">develop</ins> which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, sir!" cried the Colonel.
"Nothing of the sort, sir! Mrs. Merryweather,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
I hoped you were teaching this fellow
better manners. Symptoms, indeed! You
have seen no symptoms in me, of anything
except pure pleasure&mdash;pleasure in everything
except the gabbling of a goose!"</p>

<p>"Surely not, dear friend!" said Mrs.
Merryweather, laughing. "But all the same,
I think I should not try to detain you when
once you had made up your mind that Hugh
needed you."</p>

<p>"All against me!" cried the Colonel.
"'The little dogs and all'&mdash;I beg ten thousand
pardons, my dear madam; you know
the quotation! Well," he added, his face
changing suddenly as he turned to Mrs. Merryweather
and spoke in a lower tone, "fortunate
old fellow, eh? to have one young face&mdash;two,
perhaps, for my Giraffe loves me
too&mdash;brighten when one comes. Ah! you,
with all your wealth&mdash;richest woman of my
acquaintance, give you my honor!&mdash;cannot
tell what these boys mean to me. Hilda, too:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
most astonishing how I miss that child! but
all your young people are so good to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Colonel!" cried Gertrude from the other
end of the table. "Will you come with me
in my canoe after tea?"</p>

<p>"Will I?" cried the Colonel. "Won't I?
Lead the way, my dear!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The young moon shone bright; the lake
lay a broad sheet of luminous black, with a
silver path stretching across it. Four canoes
lay beside the wharf, and the campers were
taking their places. In the birch canoe, the
original <i>Cheemaun</i>, Mrs. Merryweather was
going as passenger, with her husband and
Phil at bow and stern; in the <i>Nahma</i> was
Colonel Ferrers, with Gertrude and Peggy;
Kitty and Willy in the <i>Rob Roy</i>, Gerald and
Margaret in the <i>Wenonah</i>.</p>

<p>"All ready?" asked the chief. "Where
shall we go? Where are Jack and Bell?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they started ahead," said Phil. "They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
had some stunt on hand, and we are to meet
them over by the Black Shore."</p>

<p>"Ready&mdash;give way all!"</p>

<p>The paddles dipped, the canoes shot out
along the silver path, gliding swift and silent
as spirits. For a time no one spoke. The
<i>Cheemaun</i>, with the powerful arms at either
end, took the lead and kept it easily: next
came the <i>Nahma</i> and the <i>Rob</i>, nearly abreast,
and vying with each other; but the <i>Wenonah</i>
lagged behind, and seemed in no special
hurry.</p>

<p>"Like it?" asked Gerald, presently.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Margaret, softly.</p>

<p>Gerald gave a little grunt of content, and
was silent again. The paddle dipped noiseless
in the liquid silver, the dark prow crept
noiseless along the shining way.</p>

<p>"It is another world!" said Margaret
presently, still speaking under her breath.
"I never dreamed of anything like it. A
silver world! Oh!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;I was only thinking&mdash;one
ought to be very good, to live in a world so
beautiful as this, Gerald!"</p>

<p>"Some of us are, Margaret!"</p>

<p>Silence again.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully glad you like it!" said
Gerald. "I hoped you would. I've&mdash;I've
been looking forward all summer to your
coming."</p>

<p>"I was very glad to come," said Margaret,
simply. "I was afraid, but I was glad,
too."</p>

<p>"Afraid? I should like to know what you
were afraid of!"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I don't know! I have never been
with many people, you know. I have never
seen a large family together before. How
happy you all are!"</p>

<p>"That's what we are!" said Gerald.
"Especially now! I say, Margaret! the
child Toots has fallen a victim."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fallen a&mdash;what do you mean, Gerald?
not into the water?"</p>

<p>"Charms!" said Gerald. "Yours. Bowled
her over completely. Nice child, the child
Toots. Think so?"</p>

<p>"I think she looks as good as she is
beautiful," said Margaret. "Does she really
like me? I am very glad, for I know I shall
love her."</p>

<p>"Don't you think she is the image of me?"
asked Gerald, plaintively.</p>

<p>"No, I never thought of it!" said downright
Margaret. "Oh! hark, Gerald; what
is that? I hear music."</p>

<p>They listened. Directly in front of them
lay a deep black shadow, and forth from
this shadow stole notes of music, low, sweet,
almost unearthly in their purity and clearness.</p>

<p>"Evidently the stunt of Tintinnabula and
the Camelopard!" said Gerald. "That is the
Black Shore yonder, and the noise is that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of the Tree-browser's fiddle, in sooth a goodly
noise. Approach we along the moonglade!
that is what we call the wake here. Pretty?"</p>

<p>"Lovely!" murmured Margaret. "Oh!
but hush, and listen!"</p>

<p>The other canoes had slackened their speed,
and now all four crept on abreast over the
luminous water. From the black shadow
ahead forms began to detach themselves, black
rocks, dark trees stooping to the water's edge,
fir and pine, with here and there a white birch
glimmering ghostlike; and still the music
rose, ever clearer and sweeter, thrilling on the
silent air. It seemed no voice of anything
made by man; it was as if the trees spoke,
the rocks, the water, the very silence itself.
But now&mdash;now another tone was heard; a
human voice this time, a full, rich contralto,
blending with the aerial notes of the violin.</p>

<p>"Harry Monmouth!" murmured the Colonel
under his breath. "Am I alive, or is
this the gate of Heaven?"</p>

<p>"Oh! who is it?" whispered Margaret.</p>

<p>"Tintinnabula! rather a neat thing in
voices, the Tintinnabula's. Nor does the
song altogether excite to strenutation. Ah!
but that is the best yet!"</p>

<p>The notes changed. It was Schubert's
Serenade now that rose from voice and violin
together. No one stirred. The canoes were
now close inshore, and the long, soft fingers
of fir and cedar brushed Margaret's cheek as
she sat motionless, spellbound. It was a
world of soft darkness, black upon black: the
silver world they had just left seemed almost
garish as she looked back on it. Here in the
cool shadow, the voices of the night pouring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
forth their wonderful melody&mdash;"Oh!" she
thought; "if this might last forever!"</p>

<p>But it was over. Floating round a great
rock that stretched far out from the shore,
they came upon the musicians, their canoe
drawn up close to the rock.</p>

<p>"Here they are!" cried Willy. "It's Bell
and Jack, Kitty; I knew it was. You are
such a silly!"</p>

<p>"I don't care!" pouted Kitty. "It did
sound like nymphs; I am sure that is just the
way they sound."</p>

<p>"You are quite right, Kitty," said her
mother. "Children, you have given us
a great treat. May we not have some
more?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we were only waiting for you," said
Bell; "now we must have choruses, many
of them!"</p>

<p>And lying close together, the paddles
stretched across from one canoe to another,
the Merryweathers sang, to Jack's accompaniment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
song after song in chorus: German
student songs, with merry refrain of "<i>vivallera
la</i>" and "<i>juch heira sa sa!</i>" Scottish
ballads and quaint old Highland boat-songs;
till Mr. Merryweather declared that it was
time to go home.</p>

<p>So home they went, down the moonglade
once more, across the glimmering floor of the
lake, singing as they went; till, twinkling
through the fringe of trees, they saw the
lights of the Camp, and the long outline of
the float, and the boats swinging at their
moorings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>AFTER THE PICNIC</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">And</span> what comes next on the programme?"
asked the Chief.</p>

<p>"Coma, I should say," replied Colonel
Ferrers. "After that watermelon, I see
nothing else for it. It's my avowed belief
that my nephew there could not stir if his
life depended on it; it stands to reason.
The boy has eaten more than his own weight.
Monstrous!"</p>

<p>"What a frightful calumny!" cried Jack,
laughing. "Really, Uncle Tom, you cannot
expect me to sit still under that."</p>

<p>He rose lightly to his feet, and grasping a
branch of the tree above his head, drew himself
up, and after kicking his long legs several
times in the air, finally twisted them round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the branch, and in another moment had disappeared
in the shadowy depths of the great
hemlock.</p>

<p>"Oh! I say!" his voice floated down.
"This is a great tree to climb. You'd better
come up, Uncle Tom, if you feel the slightest
symptoms of coma."</p>

<p>The other lads did not wait to be invited,
but flung themselves at the tree, and were
soon lost to sight, though not to sound.
Colonel Ferrers turned to his hostess with a
frown which tried hard not to turn into a
smile.</p>

<p>"Now, did you ever hear of such impudence
as that?" he asked. "These young
fellows of to-day are the most impudent
scoundrels I ever came across. Time was,
though, when we could have climbed a tree
with the best of them; eh, Merryweather?"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you could now, Colonel,"
said his host, "if you were put to it; but
I confess it is more comfortable under a tree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
than in it, nowadays, especially after a Gargantuan
feast like this."</p>

<p>It had indeed been a great picnic. The
boys, while on a tramp, had discovered a
grove of pines and hemlocks, huge old trees,
which had unaccountably escaped the woodman's
axe. The pines shot up straight and
tall for a hundred feet and more, their trunks
seamed and scarred, their clouds of dusky
green plumes tossing far overhead; the hemlocks
were no less massive in girth, but they
were twisted into all manner of grotesque
shapes, and their feathery branches hung low,
making a dense canopy over the heads of the
picnickers. Here, under one of these hemlocks,
the cloth had been laid, and decorated
with ferns and hemlock tassels. Then the
baskets were unpacked, and the campers
feasted as only dwellers in the open air
can feast. Ham and pasty, sandwiches and
rolls, jam and doughnuts&mdash;nothing seemed
to come amiss; and they finished off with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
watermelon of such mighty proportions that
it took all the united energies of the boys to
dispose of it.</p>

<p>But it was finally disposed of, and now
came the hour that is apt to be a little difficult
at picnics; the hour between the feast
and the going home.</p>

<p>"I have a new game," said Mrs. Merryweather.
"Perhaps you would like to try it
presently; but first, Colonel Ferrers, while
the boys are skylarking, or rather tree-larking,
up there, I want to hear the story you
were telling Miles on the drive over. I could
not hear very well on the back seat, and besides,
I was making up my game. It was
some adventure of yours when you were a
boy."</p>

<p>"Capital story!" said Mr. Merryweather.
"Do tell it, Colonel; I want to hear it again."</p>

<p>The Colonel smiled, and puffed meditatively
at his cigar.</p>

<p>"Story of the barrel, eh?" he said. "Upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
my word, now, I think it is pretty hard to
make me tell that story before all these young
people. What do you say, Gertrude? you
don't want to hear about your old friend's
being a young fool, do you?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Colonel Ferrers," said Gertrude; "a
story that makes your eyes twinkle so must
be one that we all want to hear. Do begin,
please!"</p>

<p>And all the girls, who had been putting
away the table-cloth and "tidying-up" generally,
gathered about the Colonel in an eager
group.</p>

<p>"Well! well!" he said, glancing from one
bright face to another. "After all, what are
we old fogies for, but to point a moral and
adorn a tale? Listen, then. This happened
when I was a young jackanapes of about my
nephew's age; I knew everything in the world
then, you understand, and nobody else knew
much of anything. That was my belief, as
it is the belief of most young men."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Uncle," said a voice from above, "there
are three young men up here who are prepared
to drop things on your head if you
slander their generation."</p>

<p>"Slander your generation, sir?" cried the
Colonel, "by likening it to my own? Of all
the monstrous insolence I ever heard&mdash;you
may be thankful, sir, that I name yours in
the same breath with it. Be good enough to
hold your tongue, sir, and attend to your business,
which is that of listening to me. Well,
my dear madam, at the period of which I
speak, I was in the office of my uncle, Marmaduke
Ferrers, India merchant, importer of
tea, silks, that sort of thing. Learning the
trade, you understand; though, as I say,
I was not aware that there was anything in
particular to learn. This is one of the lessons
I did learn. One day I was sent to the warehouse
to count some barrels, and see them
stowed away in the vault where they belonged.
They were a special thing, barrels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of minerals for some collection museum, I
forget what. Out of our own line, but we
had undertaken to store and keep them for a
time. The vault was directly under the warehouse,
which was some way from the office.
So! I went down and found no one there;
The men were at their dinner, you understand.
They may have been a little in a hurry, may
have started a few minutes before the bell
rang; I don't know how it was. At any rate,
I was in a towering passion; thought the whole
business was going to the dogs for want of
discipline, wanted to dismiss every man in the
warehouse. Men who had been there before
I was born, and knew more about tea than I
was likely to know in my lifetime. Well,
sir, it came into my ass's head that I would
give these men a lesson, show them that
there was some one in the place that meant to
have things done when he wanted them done.
I would stow those barrels myself. I was
strong as a bull, you remember&mdash;I beg ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
thousand pardons! you and your husband
were infants when this happened; not out of
long clothes, I am positive. But I was
uncommonly strong, and thought Milo and
Hercules would have found me a tough subject
to tackle. Well&mdash;speaking of tackle&mdash;there
was the rope and pulley, all ready
for lowering; block up at the ceiling, rope
dangling,&mdash;just over the trap that led into
the vault. There were the barrels; nothing
was easier, I thought. Child's play; I would
have every one of the barrels lowered and
stowed before those scoundrels came back
from their dinner. I pushed the first barrel
to the edge of the trap (lifted the trap-door
first, you understand), hooked on the 'fall,'
pleased as Punch with myself&mdash;the only man
in the world, I give you my word; then I got
a good hold on the rope, and&mdash;kicked the
barrel over the edge."</p>

<p>"Oh! Colonel Ferrers!" cried the girls.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" roared the boys in the tree.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Loaded with minerals, you understand!
stone, metal, I don't know what. The barrel
went down, and I went up."</p>

<p>"<i>Oh!</i> Colonel Ferrers!"</p>

<p>"Up to the ceiling, I give you my word.
High room, too, great warehouse, twenty feet
if it was one. There I hung, and there I
swung, a spectacle for gods and men."</p>

<p>"What <i>did</i> you do?" asked Mrs. Merryweather,
as soon as she could control her
laughter. "Dear friend, it is most heartless
to laugh, but how can we help it? How did
you ever get down? did you have to wait till
the men came back?"</p>

<p>"No, madam. My pride would not allow
that. I learned my lesson, or a part of it,
while I hung there like Mahomet's coffin; I
learned that Gravitation did not trouble itself
about superior young men; but I did not learn
all that there was to learn; that took the sequel.
Well, I hung there, as I say, revolving
slowly; centrifugal force, you understand; I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
was really exemplifying the workings of natural
forces; interesting demonstration, if there
had been any one there to see. My crumb of
comfort was that there was no one. I must
get down before those men came back from
dinner; that was the one thing necessary in
the world at that moment. I measured the
space of the trap as I swung; I prided myself
on my correct eye; you see I was a most
complete ass: I have seen only a few completer.
I thought I could jump down astride
of the trap, so to speak, and get no harm. I
came down the rope, hand over fist, till I got
to the end of it; only about six feet between
me and safety: then I jumped."</p>

<p>"And did you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, my dear madam, I did not. I went
down into the cellar, on top of the barrel, and
I carry the mark of the edge of that barrel on
my shoulders to this day, and shall to my
latest day. And the moral of this story,"
the Colonel concluded, glancing up into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
depths of the great hemlock, "the moral, my
young friends, is: wait till you know something
before you decide that you know everything."</p>

<p>When the laughter had subsided, Mr. Merryweather
said: "Your story, Colonel, reminds
me of a scrape that Roger and I once got into,
years ago. No, it wasn't Roger, it was my
brother Will. My children all know it, but it
may be new to you and our other guests. It
happened when we were out sailing one day,
on this very pond. The water was pretty low
that year, and we got over into a cove on the
north side, where we seldom went, and didn't
know the ground thoroughly. Indeed, in
very low water, one is apt to find that one
doesn't know any ground thoroughly. New
ledges and rocks are constantly cropping out&mdash;as
you shall hear. Well, we were sailing
along in fine style, before a fair wind, when
suddenly&mdash;we ran aground."</p>

<p>"On the shore?" asked the Colonel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; on a rock. It was getting dark,
and we could not see very well, but I could
see a nose of rock, and it looked like the end
of a ledge. 'I'll get out and shove her off!'
said I. I sounded with an oar, and found the
water barely ankle-deep on the ledge. So I
took off my shoes and stockings, rolled up my
trousers a little, and stepped in&mdash;up to my
neck!"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" roared the Colonel. "Ho! ho!
that was sport. I wish I had seen you."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment!" said the Chief. "The
picture is not ready for exhibition yet. When
Will had got through laughing at me, he went
to work&mdash;I found I could not stir the boat
alone&mdash;he went to work and got ready.
Stripped to the skin&mdash;he had on a new
suit, and was something of a dandy in those
days&mdash;stepped carefully overboard&mdash;and
landed in water three inches deep."</p>

<p>"Merryweather, you are making this up!"</p>

<p>"Indeed I am not, my dear sir. There we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
stood, I up to my chin, he with his toes under
water, and laughed till we were so weak that
we had to go ashore and sit down before we
had strength to push that boat off. There is
my Roland for your Oliver, Colonel. And
now, Miranda, I think we are ready for your
game. Come down, boys!"</p>

<p>The boys came scrambling down, still
laughing over the stories, and soon all were
seated on the carpet of dry, fragrant pine-needles.
The girls had found some oak-leaves
("It is my belief," said Mr. Merryweather,
"that if Bell went to a picnic in a coal-mine
or on a sand-bank, she would still manage
to find oak-leaves somewhere!"), and were
busily twining garlands for the heads of the
company.</p>

<p>"Are we all ready?" asked Mrs. Merryweather.
"Well! my game&mdash;a very simple
one&mdash;is called <i>Vocabulary</i>. It came from
my reading the other day an admirable little
book written by a wise professor, in which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
deplores the poverty of our vocabularies, and
makes a suggestion for our enlarging them.
He advises us to add two or three words to
our list every week. The first time we use a
new word, he says, it will be embarrassing to
us and, it may be, amusing to our hearers;
but if we have courage and patience, we shall
be doing a good work not only for ourselves,
but for all our generation and the generations
that are to come. Well, this naturally
appealed to me, and I was thinking of proposing
it to you all this evening; and then,
as we were driving over, it occurred to me
that it might be made into a rather amusing
game."</p>

<p>"Miranda," said her husband, "is there
anything in life that you do <i>not</i> think can be
made into a rather amusing game? But go
on!"</p>

<p>"Dear Mammy!" said Phil. "Do you remember
when you and I both had the toothache,
and you thought it might be amusing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to count the jumps and see how many there
were in a minute?"</p>

<p>"Well, so it would have been," said his
mother, "if we had only had a little more
fortitude. Now if you are all going to laugh
at me, you shall not learn the game."</p>

<p>"Oh, we will be good!" exclaimed the
Merryweathers. "We truly will."</p>

<p>"The game of <i>Vocabulary</i>," said Mrs. Merryweather,
"is played thus. One&mdash;I, for example&mdash;begins
to tell a story. I say, 'I went
out to walk this morning, and I met&mdash;' there
I stop short, and you, in turn, give a verb
synonymous, more or less, with 'met.' This
goes around the circle till some one cannot find
a verb, and that some one must continue the
story, stopping at any word he likes. I fear
this is not very clear; perhaps we can illustrate
it best playing it. I will begin as I
suggested. I went out to walk this morning,
and on my way I met&mdash;" she stopped.</p>

<p>"Encountered!" said Mr. Merryweather.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Approached!" said the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Ran up against!" said Gerald.</p>

<p>"Fell afoul of!" said Phil.</p>

<p>"Fell in with!" said Bell.</p>

<p>"Peggy, you come next."</p>

<p>"Oh! I can't!" cried poor Peggy. "They
have said everything; Mrs. Merryweather, I
can't <i>ever</i> play anything of this kind, you
know. I am too stupid."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my child; you are not in the
least stupid. If you cannot think of a word,
go on with the story."</p>

<p>"But I don't know how!" cried Peggy,
her eyes growing large and round, with a look
that Gertrude and Margaret knew only too
well. The tears were not far behind those
round blue eyes; and Margaret hastened to
the rescue. "You met a man, dear!" she
whispered. "That is all you need say."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I met a man!" said Peggy, with
a gasp.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" cried Mrs. Merryweather.
"This is rather terrible, I think. There
seem to be more terms to express personal
violence than anything else."</p>

<p>"We haven't begun to give them all,
either!" said Phil. "If we are allowed to
use modern slang&mdash;I know you prefer ancient,
Mammy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know you are a saucy boy!" said his
mother.</p>

<p>"My dear friends," said the Chief, rising.
"This is all very fine: but the simple fact is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
it is beginning to rain, and I think it advisable
for us to beat, fustigate, (where <i>did</i> you
get that, Miranda?) or wallop, a retreat!"</p>

<p>Then there was scrambling up, and running
to and fro, and gathering up of baskets and
shawls. The good old horse, which had been
grazing peacefully in a clearing hard by, was
harnessed, and Mr. and Mrs. Merryweather,
Colonel Ferrers, and the <i>impedimenta</i> bundled
in and off as hastily as might be. Finally, as
the rain began to pour down in good earnest,
the younger campers gathered into a solid
phalanx and walked home across the fields,
singing in chorus, and informing all whom
it might concern that they were</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>KITTY AND WILLY</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Ma!</span>" said Willy Merryweather.</p>

<p>"Baa!" replied his mother, without looking
up from her writing.</p>

<p>Willy fidgeted, and looked over his
shoulder. "Mammy, I wish you would
speak to Kitty."</p>

<p>"Speak to Kitty? certainly. How do you
do, Kitty?"</p>

<p>Willy looked uncomfortable, but went on.</p>

<p>"I spoke for the Rangeley boat, and now
she wants it. She always wants it, and it
isn't fair."</p>

<p>"I don't always want it, Willy! I haven't
been in it for two days. I think you are
very unkind."</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Merryweather had finished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
her sentence; she looked up, and surveyed
the two children with a half-abstracted
gaze.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked, abruptly. "I
thought Kitty and Willy were here."</p>

<p>Kitty took hold of the hem of her apron,
and Willy felt of the knife in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" repeated Mrs. Merryweather
in a tone of wonder. "You should
always answer a question, you know."</p>

<p>"We are Kitty and Willy ourselves!"
murmured the children, the red beginning to
creep around their ears.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Mrs. Merryweather, reprovingly.
"Don't say such things as that, my
dears. I know Kitty and Willy perfectly
well; they are brother and sister, two cheerful,
affectionate children, who love each other.
I don't know anything about you two; run
away, please, for I am busy."</p>

<p>As the children moved slowly away, she
called after them: "If you should see Kitty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and Willy, you might send them to me, if you
please!"</p>

<p>Round on the other side of the big oak-tree,
sheltered from the eyes that looked so
abstractedly over their glasses, Willy rubbed
his shoulders uncomfortably against the bark,
while Kitty kicked a bit of stick to and fro.</p>

<p>"There isn't any use in talking to Mammy
when she does that way!" said Willy, half
to himself, but with a side glance at Kitty.
"If she would have only listened to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She never will!" said Kitty, responding
to the half glance. "She always says there
is no need of quarrelling, and she doesn't see
why she should have to hear disagreeable
remarks."</p>

<p>"Other children scrap," said Willy. "I
don't see why we can't now and then."</p>

<p>"Well, she just won't have it, Will, so
where's the use? Never mind about the
Rangeley; you may have it, and I'll take
the <i>Wobbler</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't care!" said Willy. "You may
have her."</p>

<p>"So may you!"</p>

<p>Silence. Willy rubbing his shoulders, Kitty
kicking her bit of stick.</p>

<p>Presently Kitty looked up brightly, and
shook her curls back. "I've got over mine,
Willy!" she announced. "Are you getting
over yours?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es!" said Willy, slowly. "I&mdash;s'pose
I am."</p>

<p>"Why don't we go together?" asked Kitty.
"Then we can both have the Rangeley."</p>

<p>"All right!" said Willy, brightening at
once. "Where shall we go? We might
play Pirate a bit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then go for the milk! That would
be great!"</p>

<p>"All right, come on, Kit."</p>

<p>"Oh! but, Willy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"We must go <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'and and'">and</ins> tell Mammy first."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more the two children presented
themselves before their mother, who was still
writing busily. At the first "Mammy!" she
looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"Well, dears!" she said, "I was wondering
where you were. What are you going
to play this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"We thought perhaps we might have the
Rangeley together, and play Pirate!" said
Willy.</p>

<p>"And then go for the milk!" said Kitty.</p>

<p>"To be sure!" said Mrs. Merryweather.
"Yes, Papa said you might have the boat if
you wanted it. That will be very nice, only
be careful, dears. Give Mammy a kiss, and
have a great good time."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Run her up!" said the Pirate Captain.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!" replied the mate.</p>

<p>The Jolly Roger fluttered up to the mast-head:
skull and crossbones black as ink could
make them, ground very nearly white; it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
a splendid flag. The Captain was a terrible
figure, clad in yellow oilskins many sizes too
big for him, with ferocious mustaches curling
up to his eyes. His belt contained a perfect
armory of weapons; item, a pistol that
had lost its barrel; item, three wooden daggers,
assorted sizes; item, one tomahawk,
home-made. The mate was scarcely less terrifying,
for though a blue petticoat showed
beneath his oilskin jacket, and curls flowed
from under his sou'wester, he made up for it
by a mass of oakum beard and whisker that
was truly awe-inspiring. Also, he had the
truncheon which used to be a curling stick,
and a deadly weapon of singular appearance
which was understood to be a boomerang.</p>

<p>"Look out, Bill! avast there! dost see any
foes about?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir! I see a craft on the jib
boom&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Lee bow</i>, Kitty!&mdash;I mean Bill; not jib
boom! You are always saying that."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/gs03.jpg" width="500" height="376" alt="&quot;&#39;&#39;TIS NOT A PLATE SHIP!&#39;&quot;" title="&quot;&#39;&#39;TIS NOT A PLATE SHIP!&#39;&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;&#39;TIS NOT A PLATE SHIP!&#39;&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"I meant lee bow!" said Bill, anxious to
please. "Anyhow, I see a craft, your Honor.
I think she is a plate ship from the Spanish
Main. Shall we run her down?"</p>

<p>"Give me the glass!" exclaimed the Pirate
Captain: and through that instrument, which
the ignorant might have mistaken for a battered
tin horn, he scrutinized the "craft,"
which lay on the water at some distance.</p>

<p>"'Tis not a plate ship!" he announced at
length. "I think we have had enough plate
ships lately. This is a Dutch lugger from
Samarcand, laden with raisins and fig-paste
and lichi nuts and cream dates. I shouldn't
wonder if she had narghiles too, and scimitars,&mdash;I
need a new scimitar,&mdash;and all sorts
of things. Up helm, and crowd on all sail in
pursuit!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir! stunsels?"</p>

<p>"Stunsels, balloon-jibs, topgallant spinnakers,
royal skyscrapers, everything you can
think of. Ha! we are off! Row hard now,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Bill! The lubbers are asleep, and we shall
run them down easily. Are the cutlasses
ready?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!"</p>

<p>"Ho! we are gaining on them. Ho, ho!
bend to your oars, my hearties! grappling-chains
ready there! ho! on to the chase!"</p>

<p>Now Phil was very busy making a fly for
lake trout, and explaining the manufacture
of it to Peggy; and Peggy was absorbed in
watching him, and in counting the number of
separate aches she felt after her first lesson
in rowing. Moreover, the bloody pirates
had conducted their conversation in a half-whisper,
and the wind was the other way.
But suddenly, Peggy looked up and saw
them, now at only a few yards distance.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" she cried. "What is
it? Do look, Phil!"</p>

<p>Phil looked hastily around; chuckled, and
fell into an attitude of abject terror.
"Mercy! mercy!" he cried; cowering down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
in his seat. ("It's the kids; please be frightened!)
Oh! what will become of us? We
are lost!"</p>

<p>"Oh! save me, spare me!" cried Peggy,
following suit, and clasping her hands in
supplication.</p>

<p>The pirate bark ran alongside, and grappling-
irons were tossed aboard the ill-fated
merchantman. The Pirate Captain, standing
in the stern of his vessel, surveyed them with
baleful looks.</p>

<p>"What ship is this?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Weeping Woodchuck</i>, Captain Zebedee
Moses of Squedunk, please your Honor's
Worship!"</p>

<p>"Well I am Captain England, and this is
the <i>Gory Griffin</i>. If you have a cargo of
raisins and fig-paste and cream dates, hand
them over; otherwise, prepare to walk the
plank this instant!"</p>

<p>"Oh, spare us! spare this tender maiden!"
cried Phil. "I have no fig-paste, but wouldn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
fresh doughnuts do as well, O man of blood?
Life is sweet&mdash;and fish is needed for supper!"</p>

<p>At these remarks the pirate's ferocious
scowl relaxed somewhat. "Hand over your
doughnuts!" he said, briefly. "This once I
spare ye, but cross not my path again! I
jolly well forgot about tea," he added, as
Phil tossed him some doughnuts; "I suppose
it must be about time to go for the milk,
perhaps, is it?"</p>

<p>Phil looked at his watch. "Well, I should
say it jolly well was!" he replied. "You'd
better be off, young ones&mdash;I mean Scourges
of the Deep!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was quite a pull over to the point where
the milk-cans were waiting, but Kitty and
Willy were both good oars, and the doughnuts
were crisp and fortifying.</p>

<p>"Let's take the point by storm!" suggested
the gallant England, who had not
had his fill of glory. "The cans might be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
treasure, you know, and we can creep up
silently."</p>

<p>"But there's no one to hear us be silent!"
said Kitty.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nothing! We can hear ourselves,
and, anyhow, it is good practice.
Come on, now! Be silent as the grave!"
Leaving the boat on the shore, they crept up
the beach, pounced on the milk-can,&mdash;a tall
"separator" which held the whole provision
for the family supper and breakfast,&mdash;and
bore it in triumph to the boat. But, alas!
for the gallant pirates! In getting aboard,
one of them slipped; the other stumbled;
between the two, neither could tell just how,
the tall can toppled, and fell into the boat;
the stopper flew out&mdash;"Then all the mighty
floods were out!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"But where <i>can</i> the children be?" asked
Mrs. Merryweather, for the tenth time.</p>

<p>The horn had blown for supper, the fish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
were fried, the campers were hungry and
thirsty; and the milk had not come.</p>

<p>"Where <i>can</i> they be?" said every one.</p>

<p>Mr. Merryweather put down the glass
with which he had been sweeping the lake.
"They are out there!" he said. "I see
them, but they don't seem to be rowing.
Give me the megaphone, will you, Jerry?
Thanks!"</p>

<p>A calm roar went out across the lake.
"Come&mdash;in&mdash;to&mdash;tea!"</p>

<p>A faint pipe was heard in reply. "Don't&mdash;want&mdash;any&mdash;tea!"</p>

<p>The second roar was still calm, but peremptory.
"<i>Come&mdash;in!</i>"</p>

<p>Slowly, very slowly, the oars rose and fell,
and the boat crept over the water. What
could be the matter with the children?</p>

<p>"Too much bloodshed has upset the gallant
England!" said Phil. "When it comes to
Willy's not wanting his tea!"</p>

<p>"They have had some accident!" said Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Merryweather. "Broken an oar, probably,
or lost a rowlock. No. They are both rowing.
Well, here they come."</p>

<p>The whole family started for the wharf,
but a piteous wail arose from the now approaching
boat.</p>

<p>"Please don't everybody come down! we
want just Papa and Mamma."</p>

<p>"Stay here, dear people, please!" said
Mrs. Merryweather; and both parents hurried
down to the wharf, toward which two
dejected little figures were now tugging a
very heavy boat.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Will?" said Mr.
Merryweather. "Speak up, son."</p>

<p>"We&mdash;spilt the milk!" said Willy, in a
carefully measured tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dears! all of it?" inquired their
mother.</p>

<p>"Every drop!" said Willy, grimly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mammy, we are so sorry!" cried
Kitty. "The old can&mdash;just&mdash;upset! and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
we are so wet, and it keeps splashing all over
my legs!"</p>

<p>"There! there! come ashore; never mind
about the milk!" said Mr. Merryweather.</p>

<p>"Never mind!" echoed Mrs. Merryweather,
heartily. "My poor chicks, where have you
been all this time? Why didn't you come
straight home?"</p>

<p>"We were&mdash;afraid!" sobbed Kitty. "We
have been rowing around for ever and ever so
long, and we are so tired, and hungry, and&mdash;wet&mdash;"</p>

<p>But by this time Kitty was near enough
for her father to bend down and lift her
bodily out of the boat, and put her, all dripping
milk as she was, into her mother's arms.
On her mother's shoulder she sobbed out the
rest of the pitiful little story. Kitty was
twelve, and not specially small of her age;
but she was the baby, and Mrs. Merryweather
sat down on the wharf and rocked to and fro,
hushing her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"There! there!" she said, soothingly.
"My lamb! as if all the milk in the world
were worth your crying about! and crying
into the spilt milk, too, and making the boat
all the wetter! Hush! hush! Run along,
Papa and Willy&mdash;dear little boy, it really is
only funny, so don't fret, not one little scrap.
Kitty and I will come in about two minutes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>A DISCUSSION</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning reading was over, but the
girls lingered in the pine parlor, where the
whole family had been gathered to hear some
thrilling chapters of Parkman. Margaret and
Bell had their sewing, Gertrude her drawing-board;
Peggy was carving the handle of a
walking-stick, while Kitty struggled with
some refractory knitting-needles.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant place in which they were
sitting: a little clear space of pine-needles,
embroidered here and there with tiny ferns,
and shut in by walls of dusky pine, soft and
fragrant. The tree-trunks made excellent
(though sometimes rather sticky) chair-backs;
the sunshine filtered in through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
branches overhead, making a golden half-light
which was the very essence of restfulness.</p>

<p>"Oh, pleasant place!" said Margaret,
breaking the silence that had followed the
departure of the rest of the family. "How
strange it seems, sitting here in this green
peace and quiet, to read of all those terrible
happenings. How can it be the same world?"</p>

<p>"He was a man, that La Salle!" exclaimed
Peggy. "I never heard of such a man.
Think of that winter voyage! Think of that
man, brought up in luxury, with every kind
of accomplishment, and that kind of thing,
wading in snow-water up to his knees, and
sleeping on the frozen ground, rolled in his
blanket, while his clothes dried and froze
stiff on the trees! think of him standing
alone against courts and savages, and winning
every time&mdash;till he was killed by
those wretches. It is the greatest story I
ever read. Now, if all history were like this,
Margaret, I never should complain."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you like history, Peggy?" asked
Bell, looking up in wonder.</p>

<p>"I used to detest it," said Peggy, laughing.
"Julius C&aelig;sar, and William the Conqueror,
and all those people used to bore me dreadfully,
though Margaret did her very best to
make them interesting; didn't you, you
dear?"</p>

<p>"I tried, Peggy," said Margaret, with a
smile; "but you never would admit that
they were real people, just as real as if they
were alive to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, of course I know they were
alive once, but so were mummies, and you
can't expect me to be interested in <i>them</i>.
However, I think I really am improving.
'Hereward' brought William alive for me,
it truly did; and this Parkman book delights
me. Oh! I should like to have made that
voyage down the Mississippi, girls! I think,
on the whole, I would rather be Cavalier de
La Salle than any one I ever heard of."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"In spite of all the suffering and tragedy?"
said Gertrude. "I could not say that, much
as I admire him."</p>

<p>"Who would you be, if you could choose?
Let us all say!" cried Bell. "A new game!
two minutes for reflection!" and she took out
her watch with a business-like air.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Gertrude. "But there are so
many!"</p>

<p>"Silence!" said Bell; and there was an
instant of absolute stillness. Taking advantage
of it, a chipmunk ran across the brown
carpet, and pausing midway, sat up on his
haunches and surveyed the new and singular
mountain ranges that had risen on his horizon.
One of the mountains stirred&mdash;whisk! he
was gone.</p>

<p>"Time's up!" said Bell. "Margaret, I
will begin with you. With all history to
choose from, who will you be?"</p>

<p>"Oh! must I be first?" cried Margaret.
"As Gertrude says, there are so many; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
yet when you come to think them over, there
is something against every one; I mean something
one would not like to do or to suffer.
But,&mdash;on the whole,&mdash;I <i>think</i> I would be
Elizabeth of Hungary."</p>

<p>"Our Lady of the Roses? Well, she was
lovely, though I should be sorry to marry her
husband. The story would have been somewhat
different if I had; but I am not a saint.
Peggy, your turn!"</p>

<p>"This man we are reading about!" said
Peggy, decidedly. "La Salle!"</p>

<p>"Toots!"</p>

<p>"Bell, you know I never <i>can</i> decide between
Shakespeare and Raphael. I have to
be both; they lived quite far enough apart for
separate incarnations."</p>

<p>"Greedy, grasping girl!" said Bell. "Kitty,
who are you?"</p>

<p>"Jim Hawkins!" said Kitty, promptly.</p>

<p>"No fiction allowed this time, Missy, only
history!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear! well, then&mdash;Francis Drake!"</p>

<p>"Bound to have a pirate, aren't you,
Kitty?" said Gertrude, mischievously.</p>

<p>"He wasn't a pirate!" cried Kitty, indignantly.
"He was a great hero."</p>

<p>"<i>L'un n'emp&ecirc;chait pas l'autre</i>, in those
days!" said Bell.</p>

<p>"Well, now for yourself, Bell!" said Margaret.
"It is your turn."</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't need any two minutes," said
Bell. "I am always William the Silent. I
should be Beethoven if it were not for the
deafness, but that I could not have borne."</p>

<p>"You all want to be men, don't you?"
observed Margaret, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes, so we do! you are the only
one who chose a woman."</p>

<p>"Everybody would be a man if they
could!" cried Peggy, throwing grammar to
the winds, as she was apt to do when
excited.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, everybody would not!" cried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Margaret, her soft eyes lighting up. "Nothing
would induce me to be a man."</p>

<p>"I don't think you would make a very
good one, to be sure!" said Peggy, looking
affectionately at her cousin. "But I bet&mdash;I
mean wager&mdash;you told me I might say
'wager,' Margaret!&mdash;that none of the other
girls would hesitate a minute if they had the
chance. I wouldn't! Think of it! No petticoats,
no fuss, no having to remember to do
this, and not to do that; and no hairpins, or
gloves, or best hats&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Bell; "that is only the smallest
part, Peggy. I don't mind the hairpin
part&mdash;though of course it is a joy to get out
here and dispense with them&mdash;but still, that
is only a trifle. The thing I think about is
the freedom, the strength, the power to go
right ahead and <i>do</i> things!" and, as she
spoke, Bell threw her head back and stretched
her arms abroad with a vigorous gesture.
"Of course we girls are all well and strong,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
but it isn't the same strength as a man's.
We are constantly running up against things
we cannot, ought not to do. I <i>do</i> envy the
boys, I cannot help it."</p>

<p>"Yes!" cried Margaret, leaning forward, a
soft flush rising to her cheeks. "I know&mdash;it
is glorious to see them; but, Bell, isn't the
very weakness part of our strength? Isn't it
just because women <i>know</i> the&mdash;the things
they cannot do, that they are able to understand
and sympathize, and&mdash;and help, in
ways that men cannot, because they do not
know?"</p>

<p>"I think Margaret is right!" said Gertrude,
slowly. "And besides, there is strength
and strength, Bell. For long endurance of
pain or hardship, the woman will outlast the
man nine times out of ten, I believe; and I
heard Doctor Strong say once that women
would often bear pain quietly that would set
a man raving. Yes, I come over to your side,
May Margaret. I would take Joan of Arc, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
it were not for the stake. Let me see&mdash;oh,
I know! I will be Grace Darling."</p>

<p>"Who was she?" asked Kitty.</p>

<p>"The lighthouse-keeper's daughter, at Longstone,
off the Yorkshire coast. A ship, the
<i>Forfarshire</i>, was wrecked on the rocks near
by, and there seemed no chance of saving
any of the crew; but Grace persuaded her
father to try, and just those two rowed out,
in a most terrible storm, to the reef on which
the vessel had been wrecked, and saved the
nine men, all that were left out of sixty-three,
who were clinging to the rocks, waiting
for death. Why wasn't that just as fine as
commanding an army, or even leading a forlorn
hope in battle? Then there was dear
Margaret Roper&mdash;I think she is the one for
you, May Margaret!&mdash;and Cochrane's Bonny
Grizzy, and&mdash;oh, ever and ever so many of
them. Yes, I take up my stand once and for
all on my own side."</p>

<p>"Well!" said Bell, shaking her head. "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
hear what you say, Betsy, but it makes no
difference,&mdash;does it, Peggy?&mdash;though I admit
the force of your remarks."</p>

<p>"Not a bit!" said Peggy. "I wouldn't
have been Mrs. La Salle for a farm."</p>

<p>"There wasn't any!" said Margaret.</p>

<p>"The principle remains the same," said
Peggy, "as Miss Russell used to say."</p>

<p>"There is another thing!" said Margaret.
"Your life out here, Bell, shows me how
much girls <i>can</i> do; I mean in the active,
outdoor, athletic way. More than I ever
dreamed they could do. It really seems to
me that, except just for the petticoats, you
have very few drawbacks. I suppose it is
having all the brothers. Why, you know
as much as they do about the woods and
all."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's partly the boys," said Bell; "but
it is much more Papa. You see, from the
time we could walk, he has always taken us
out into the woods and fields, and made us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
use our eyes and ears, and talked to us about
things. We should not know anything, if it
were not for Papa."</p>

<p>"He does seem to know almost everything!"
said Margaret. "I never saw any
one like him."</p>

<p>"There <i>isn't</i> any one like him," said Gertrude,
decidedly. "What have you got there,
Margaret?"</p>

<p>Margaret had drawn a letter from her
pocket, and was looking it over.</p>

<p>"An argument on my side," she said, smiling.
"May I read it aloud?"</p>

<p>"Do! do!" cried all the girls.</p>

<p>Margaret smoothed out the crumpled pages
affectionately. "He carried it in his pocket
two days before he remembered to post it!"
she said. "I judge from the date, and the
appearance of the envelope. There was
candy in his pocket, and"&mdash;she sniffed
at the letter&mdash;"yes! tar, without doubt.
Now listen!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'<span class="smcap">Dear Cousin Margaret</span>:&mdash;We miss
you awfully, and Uncle John says it is no
kind of a house without you, and it isn't.
We went a walk yesterday, Susan D. and me
and the dogs, because you know it was Sunday;
Uncle John was coming too, but he had
roomatizm and coud not. Well Cousin Margaret,
we walked over the big hill and just
then the dogs began howling and yelling in
the most awful manner, and running round
and round like they were crazy; and we ran
to see what was up, and we found out, I tell
you! It was white hornets, about ten thousand
of them, and the dogs had rolled in a
nest of them, and they were stinging their
noses, and they flew at us with perfeck fewry,
I mean the hornets did. I hollered and ran,
but Susan D. said wait she knew what to do,
so she said "Come on," and we ran down to
the brook and she took mud and put it on
my stings before she touched her own, and
it took a good deal of the pane out though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
not all. And then she put it on the dogs'
noses, and they understood like persons, and
poked them into the mud themselves and soon
forgot their pane. But I thought I would tell
you this Cousin Margaret, because Susan D.
did really behave like a perfeck brick, and
you always said girls were as brave as boys
but I never thought so before but now I do;
because I hollered right out when they stung
me which I am ashamed of. You said confession
was good for the sole, and so I think:
so now I will say good-by from</p>

<div class='right'>
"'<span class="smcap">Basil</span>.'"<br />
</div></div>

<p>"What a dear boy!" cried Gertrude.</p>

<p>"Oh, he is!" said Margaret, the happy
tears springing to her eyes. "He is one of
the very dearest boys that ever lived, Gertrude;
so manly and honest, and so funny,
too. Gerald knows him!" she added, shyly.
"I wish he had been at home when you were
there, Peggy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; he must be a brick!" said Peggy.
"Now, Margaret, you know he is, and you
know that nothing but 'brick' expresses
what I mean. Girls, I appeal to you. Margaret
wants me to talk like a professor all the
time, and I am not a professor, and am never
likely to be one. Bell, isn't 'brick' all
right?"</p>

<p>Bell looked conscious. "I confess I say it,
Peggy; I confess it seems much heartier than
the same thing in what my mother calls good
English. Still&mdash;I believe it would sound very
queer to me if she used it; the mother, I
mean."</p>

<p>"Grace used to say 'a quadrangular piece
of baked clay!'" said Gertrude. "Don't you
remember, Peggy?"</p>

<p>"So she did&mdash;dear thing! Well, but, Bell,
would you have girls talk just the way
grown-up people do? It would sound awfully
stiff and poky. I don't mean that it sounds so
when your mother talks!" she cried; "of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
course you know I don't mean that. But
girls <i>aren't</i> grown-up, you know."</p>

<p>"But they are going to be!" said Margaret.
"If they don't learn good English
now, how are they going to do it later? It
does seem to me a terrible pity, with all our
great, glorious language, to use so little of it,
and to use it so often wrong. You may think
me priggish and professorial, and anything else
you like, Peggy dear, but that is what I
think."</p>

<p>"I love you to distraction," said Peggy;
"you are an angel, but I think you carry it
too far. What would you say instead of
'brick?' how would you describe this boy&mdash;who
simply <i>is</i> a brick?"</p>

<p>Margaret reflected. "I should say he was
a nice, manly boy!" she said, presently.</p>

<p>"Nice! now, Margaret! 'nice' is niminy,
you know it is, and piminy too."</p>

<p>"The great advantage of 'brick,'" said Bell,
"is that it is one word, and 'nice manly boy'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
is three, and doesn't mean the same thing
then."</p>

<p>"There!" cried Peggy, in triumph. "What
do you say to that, Margaret? Find one word
in your old 'good English' that does express
'brick?'"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it isn't easy!" Margaret admitted.
"'Trump' is the only one I can think of, and
I suppose that was slang fifty years ago."</p>

<p>"The mother says that when a word has
held its own for twenty years, it isn't slang
any more," said Gertrude. "The question
is&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment the sound of a horn was
heard; a long, ringing blast, followed by a
second and a third.</p>

<p>The girls sprang to their feet. "Hurrah for
a swim!" cried Bell. "Come, bricks and
trumps&mdash;I'll race you all to the tents!"
And off they went with a flash of petticoats,
leaving the chipmunk to speculate on the
sudden upheavals of nature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>WATER PLAY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> floating wharf, as has been said, lay
at the end of a long, narrow slip that ran out
on piers over the water. Down the slip, one
by one, now came the Merryweathers and
their guests, in bathing array, the boys shouting
and skylarking,&mdash;the girls singing and
tossing their long hair about. Jack and Phil
brought out a long spring-board, and set it
up at the end of the wharf; and then the fun
began. Mr. Merryweather was the first to
run along the board, and take a sober and
dignified dive. He was followed by Gerald,
turning handsprings, and carolling to the
effect that he was a pirate king, he was;
hurrah for the pirate king! Next came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Jack, who turned a back somersault, ending
with a noble splash; and so, one by one, like
so many ducks, they dove and leaped and
tumbled in, and splashed and swam about
in the clear water. Peggy was with the rest,
splashing as merrily as any of them; but
Margaret sat on the wharf, in her pretty blue
bathing-dress, her feet tucked under her,
looking on.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/gs04.jpg" width="500" height="382" alt="&quot;&#39;COME ON! COME IN!&#39;&quot;" title="&quot;&#39;COME ON! COME IN!&#39;&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;COME ON! COME IN!&#39;&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Come on, Margaret!" cried Peggy.
"Come on! come in! It's perfectly great!"</p>

<p>"In a minute," said Margaret. "I like to
watch you a bit first; it takes me a little
while to get my courage up."</p>

<p>"Come, oh, come with me!" sang Gerald,
emerging from the water, at her feet, and
clinging to the wharf, while he shook the
drops from his hair and eyes. "Come swim
with me and be my swan! Come where the
duckweed twineth! Come!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Gerald, yes; in just a minute. Is
it very cold?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cold? No; just right. Liquid crystal,
sparkling sapphire, perfection! Come, you
must have your swimming lesson. Forget
the cheerful swain,&mdash;behold the stern instructor!"</p>

<p>He held out his hand with an imperative
gesture. Margaret laid hers in it
timidly.</p>

<p>"Let me get near the rope!" she said,
rather nervously.</p>

<p>"Here is the rope, close by your hand.
Now, then, hold fast! There we go!"</p>

<p>With one hand on the rope, and the other
in Gerald's, Margaret slid into the water,
giving a little cry as it bubbled up about her.
"Gerald!"</p>

<p>"Right here, my lady. There; both hands
on the rope now. Take it easy! Now you
are all right."</p>

<p>"Ye'&mdash;yes, Gerald. Oh, isn't it glorious?"</p>

<p>"Rather! It's really the element to live<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in, you see. A mistake was made somewhere.
If I had but gills, I should ask no
more of fate. As it is&mdash;"</p>

<p>He dove, and came up on the other side
of the rope. "Don't you think I would be
charming with gills,&mdash;pretty little quivering,
rosy gills,&mdash;instead of side whiskers?"</p>

<p>"I never saw you in side whiskers," said
Margaret, demurely, "so I cannot tell. You
certainly don't seem to need the gills, though.
How <i>do</i> you manage to keep under so long?
Yesterday, when you stayed down picking up
these pebbles, I was sure something had happened.
Really, Gerald, I was very much
frightened."</p>

<p>"I ought to have been switched," said
Gerald. "I never thought of your noticing.
I say, come down with me, and I'll show you
the trick of it. It's just as easy!"</p>

<p>"Not for worlds!" cried Margaret, clutching
the rope, as if she expected to be dragged
from it by force. "I never should come up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
alive. Oh, look, Gerald! what are they going
to do now?"</p>

<p>"Going to dive over the elephants. Do
you mind&mdash;oh, here is the child, Toots.
Toots, will you stay here by Margaret, while
I take my place in the ring? You are sure
you are all right, Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; do go. I want to see it. Gertrude,
what <i>are</i> they doing?"</p>

<p>"Look and see," said Gertrude. "Put your
arms on the rope, and lift yourself higher.
That's right."</p>

<p>Phil and Jack and Willy had placed themselves
side by side, on their hands and knees,
at the edge of the wharf, and were calling
loudly for Gerald. He stepped back to the
farther end of the float, then, running forward,
soared into the air, over the backs of
the "elephants," and came down straight
as an arrow into the water; then, scrambling
out, took his place in the row, while Phil
performed the same man&#339;uvre. Over and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
over and over they went, running, rising,
plunging, rising again. Margaret grew dizzy
watching them. Now Mr. Merryweather advanced,
holding a rubber hoop, which was
neither more nor less than the discarded tire
of a bicycle. This he and Gerald held out at
arm's length, and the other boys dove through
it, amid the applause of the girls.</p>

<p>"Oh, pretty!" cried Peggy. "Do you do
that, girls?"</p>

<p>"Gertrude does; I haven't tried it yet,"
said Bell, who was floating placidly, her arms
under her head, her face turned to the sky.</p>

<p>"I am going to try," said Peggy. "May
I, Mr. Merryweather?"</p>

<p>"By all means!" said the Chief, heartily.
"Take a good run&mdash;steady, Jerry. Hold it
out well&mdash;there! hurrah!"</p>

<p>For Peggy had gone through the hoop like
a bird, and after a clean dive, was coming up
again, radiant and panting.</p>

<p>"Oh, Peggy, how splendid!" cried Margaret,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
her eyes shining with pleasure and
pride in her Peggy's prowess. "Gertrude,
didn't she do it well? Such a pretty, graceful
thing to do."</p>

<p>"<i>C'&eacute;tait une corquerre!</i>" said Gerald,
heartily. "<i>Elle est aussi une corquerre, la
Peggy.</i> You will be doing it soon yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh, never, never! You cannot seem to
understand, Gerald, that I am not <i>made</i> for
these things. I love to see them; I admire
them intensely, but I cannot so much as think
of trying."</p>

<p>"<i>Point de stonte pour Marguerite?</i>" said
Gerald. "Alas the day! Because you really
would do them so corkingly, you know, if
only you should do them. Well, see here, I
am going to give you a troll. You will like
that, I am sure."</p>

<p>"A troll? I thought they were mountain
goblins. I don't want one, thank you, sir!
water nixies and pixies are as much as I can
bear in the goblin line."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Verb, not substantive!" replied Gerald.</p>

<p>"I troll, thou lettest thyself be trolled,
he, she, or it sees you being trolled and
wishes that he, she, or it had such luck.
Observe!"</p>

<p>He climbed into one of the Rangeley boats
that lay near the float, loosed her moorings,
and, taking up the oars, brought her close to
the rope. "Now, Margaret, catch hold; here,
at the stern!"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me, Gerald?
I fear thee, ancient mariner, I fear thy
skinny hand!"</p>

<p>"I hold you with my glittering eye, you
cannot choose but come. I am going to take
you off a-trolling. Hold on tight with your
hands, and let all the rest of you go, as if you
had nothing to do with it."</p>

<p>He took a few strokes, slowly and easily.
Margaret, clinging to the stern, was drawn
along without effort or motion of her own.
Her long hair floated behind her; her white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
arms gleamed like ivory through the clear
water; her face was alight with pleasure.</p>

<p>"'Not wholly bad, Lysander Pratt?'"
quoted Gerald, interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gerald! it is almost too perfect! no,
you needn't stop, I only said <i>almost</i>. The
water feels like silk flowing by me: no, silk
is rough beside it; it feels like&mdash;like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like water, possibly?" said Gerald;
"stranger things have been."</p>

<p>"Well, there isn't anything else like it, is
there? Oh! are you sure you will not take
cold or anything, Gerald? I could go on forever,
floating here&mdash;trolling, I mean."</p>

<p>"Nothing easier," said Gerald, pulling on
with long, steady strokes. "We will just
keep on; I ask nothing better. Years passed.
A form was seen, gray and bent with age,
feebly tugging at a pair of oars. Trailing
behind the crazy boat, another figure might
be distinguished&mdash;I forbear further description,
Margaret: I may grow old, but not you;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
please stay as you are always. Anyhow, the
people will flock to the shore. Ha! the Muse!
the afflatus descends.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"The people thronged the rocky shore,<br />

<p>"Wait! she hasn't finished. Never interrupt

<p>"Just look down, Margaret! see the bottom,
all white sand; isn't that pleasant? Hi!
there's a bream watching his nest. See him
fanning about over it, never leaving the place.
He'll keep that up for hours at a time.
Domestic party, the bream! this is an excellent
opportunity to study the habits of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gerald, I am cold!"</p>

<p>"We'll be there in two minutes!" said
Gerald, settling to his oars. "Hold tight,
now, Margaret! troll as the wolves of Apennine
were all upon your track!" and with
long, powerful strokes he sent the boat flying
through the water, while Margaret fairly
shrieked with delight and excitement.</p>

<p>Her face had been turned away from the
float; but now she was speeding toward it,
and looked eagerly to see what the others of
the party were doing. To her great amazement,
no one was in sight. The wharf lay
wet and glistening in the sunshine, but no
blue-clad figures leaped and pranced across it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
no merry faces emerged from the blue, sparkling
water. All was silent and solitary.</p>

<p>"Why, Gerald," cried Margaret, "where
are they all? have they gone in? Surely I
heard their voices just a moment ago, and a
great splash: where can they be?"</p>

<p>"A stunt!" replied Gerald. "For our
benefit, I presume, but I scorn their levity.
I advise you to take no notice of their childish
pranks. I myself was young, once upon a
time, but what then?"</p>

<p>They were now at the float, and Margaret
looked about her, in utter amazement. All
was silent; not a voice, not a whisper; no
soul was in sight. It was as if she and Gerald
were alone in the world. She stepped out on
the float: at the instant, up from under her
feet rose a sound as if the biggest giant that
ever swung a club were sneezing. "A&mdash;<i>tchoo!</i>"</p>

<p>Margaret screamed outright. "Gerald!
what is it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come out from there!" cried Gerald.
"They are under the float, imbeciles that they
are. The Pater has gone ashore, and the
others manifest their nature, that is all.
Come out, Apes of the Apennines! or
I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>The threat remained unfinished, for the
Merryweathers came out. Swarming up from
under the float, where they had been treading
water at their ease, with plenty of breathing-space,
they flung themselves with one accord
upon Gerald's boat, capsized it, and dragged
him into the water. A great splashing contest
ensued, with much shouting and merriment,
and they were still hard at it when "All in!"
sounded from the boat-house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE MAIL</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Still</span> raining, Phil?" asked Mrs. Merryweather,
looking up from her writing.</p>

<p>"Still, honored parent! or rather, to be
exact, anything but still. Up on the hill, the
wind is fierce. I had to ride round the blast
once or twice, instead of going through it.
Solid old wind, that!"</p>

<p>He threw off his dripping oilskin jacket,
and came in, unslinging the letter-bag from
his shoulder as he came.</p>

<p>"Letters! letters!" he cried. "Who wants
letters?"</p>

<p>Every one gathered around him, holding
out eager hands.</p>

<p>"One for me, Phil!"</p>

<p>"For me, Protector of the Poor!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! please, Phil! I want three at least."</p>

shudder at the consequences for you!"</p>

<p>Phil distributed letters and papers; the
family subsided on chairs and benches with
their treasures, and for some minutes nothing
was heard but the rustle of paper and the
steady downpour of the rain.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Peggy, presently. "Oh&mdash;eee!
splendid!"</p>

<p>"Sapolio!" exclaimed Gerald; and "Well!
well!" said Mrs. Merryweather.</p>

<p>The three exclamations were simultaneous,
and Bell, who had no letters, raised her hand
with an imperative gesture. "Exclamation
must be followed by explanation!" she said.
"Law of the Medes and Persians. We shall
be glad to hear from the exclaimers."</p>

<p>"Who? me? did I?" asked Peggy, looking
up with sparkling eyes. "Semiramis has
eight puppies. Think of it! eight whole
puppies!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never buy more than half a puppy at a
time," said Gerald, "unless it is for a veal
and ham pie."</p>

<p>"Gerald!"</p>

<p>"Well, it's a fact, Mater; I never do.
What kind of puppies, thou of Limavaddy?"</p>

<p>"Gordon setters, black and tan: oh, she
says they are perfect beauties. She says&mdash;this
is Jean, you know, my sister&mdash;'they are
all like Semmy except one, and he is <i>blue</i>.'
Who ever heard of a blue puppy? You shall
have one, Snowy: I promised you one, don't
you remember? oh&mdash;eee! and the new colt
is a perfect beauty too, and they have named
her Peggy. Oh!"</p>

<p>Peggy looked down at her letter, then
looked up again shyly. "I&mdash;don't suppose
you would care to hear any of it?" she said,
interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Indeed we should!" said Mrs. Merryweather,
heartily. "We should like it extremely,
Peggy. A letter from the Far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
West; why, it will be a journey for all
of us."</p>

<p>"Great!" said Phil.</p>

<p>"Corking!" said Gerald. And one and all,
in their several ways, expressed their desire to
hear the letter.</p>

<p>Dimpling with pleasure, her rosy face beaming,
Peggy began to read.</p>

<p>"'Dear old'&mdash;oh, well, I won't read just
the beginning, because it is just the way we
talk to each other, you know. I wish you
knew Jean, Snowy. Let me see! oh, yes,
here it is.</p>

<p>"'This is eight birthdays all at once, for
what do you think, Peggy? this morning we
missed Semmy at breakfast, and could not
find her anywhere. There were kidneys, and
you know she always finishes the dish off, because
she is so fond of them. Well, and so I
went to look for her, and she wasn't in her
box, or in the shed, or behind the kitchen
stove, or anywhere where she usually is. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
I went out to the stable, and there I heard
little squeaks and squeals, the funniest you
ever heard, and then a growl in Semmy's
voice as I opened the door. Then the dear
thing heard my step, and was ashamed of
growling, and began thumping her tail on the
floor till I should have thought she would
break it. And there she was, all cuddled
down in a pile of hay, and the dear little
darling things all cuddled round her. I
never saw anything so perfectly dear! they
were all blind, and bald all over, and pink,
and squealing like anything; you never <i>did</i>
see anything so lovely in all your life, at least
I never did. Well, she let me take them up,
one by one, old darling, though I could see
that it made her nervous. Most of them are
like her, beautifully marked, with pink noses,
and black ears, and just the right blackness
and tanness on them; but one is very queer,
great splotches of black on his nose and his
hind quarters, and all the rest of him white.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
So they named him "Magpie," right off; but
I haven't come to the names yet. He is not
very pretty, but he looks <i>very</i> bright, and I
shouldn't wonder if he was terribly clever, to
make up for not being so handsome as the
others. And the other different one is a perfect
beauty, though you may not think so
when I tell you that he is <i>blue</i>. Yes, truly
blue; of course I don't mean sky blue, nor
navy, but the black is all mixed in through
the white,&mdash;I can't explain to you just how
it is&mdash;but anyhow, at a little distance, he
does truly and honestly look blue. Well, so&mdash;I
was the first to find them, so Father
said I might name them, but of course I
wanted us all to do it together; so we all
thought, and each made a list. Oh, Peggy,
we did want you; and I wanted to wait till
you could send your list too, but the others
thought you would not mind, and it is nicer
to have them named quickly, because then
their names seem to belong to them more,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and they look like them. Perhaps, I mean,
if you had been called something else till you
were two or three years old, you might not
have been so just exactly Peggy as you are,
you dear old thing.'</p>

<p>"Perhaps I ought not to have read that,"
said Peggy, looking up with a blush; "but it
is as like Jean as I am like Peggy, if I am
like it, whatever it is."</p>

<p>"You certainly are like 'it,'" said Gertrude,
laughing, "and 'it' certainly is a dear old
thing. Go on, please. We are all longing
to hear the list."</p>

<p>Peggy threw her a kiss, and went on.</p>

<p>"'I will not give you all the lists, for that
would take up all the rest of my letter; but
here is the one we finally made out. There
are three females, and five males, you know:
<i>Cleopatra</i>, <i>Meg</i> (Merrilies; that was Flora's,
because she is just reading "Guy Mannering"),
<i>Diana</i>, <i>Guy</i> (for the same reason),
<i>Shot</i>, <i>Hector</i>, <i>Ajax</i>, and <i>Magpie</i>.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I do think that is a queer list,"
Peggy concluded, folding up the letter. "I
wish they had called one 'Gray Brother,' or
'Bagheera.'"</p>

<p>"But they are not wolves or panthers,"
objected Mr. Merryweather. "I should say
that was a very fair list of names, Peggy, as
names go. It is always hard to find a good
name for a dog. 'Shot' is an excellent
name. We had a good old dog named Shot,
and I have always liked the name."</p>

<p>"Mammy," said Bell, "are we not to hear
something from you?"</p>

<p>"From me, my dear?" repeated Mrs.
Merryweather. "What would you like to
hear?"</p>

<p>"I should think you were an amiable
gramophone," replied her daughter, with
affectionate disrespect. "And I <i>think</i> you
really know what I mean, madam, in spite
of that innocent look. On reading your
letters, you and Jerry exclaimed: 'Well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
well!' and 'Sapolio!' at the same instant,
and your letters are on the same kind of
paper, I cannot help seeing that. Have you
something to break to us? 'Sapolio' is a
baleful utterance, delivered as Jerry delivered
it just now."</p>

<p>"Gee! I should think it was!" muttered
Gerald, gloomily. He had brightened up
while Peggy was reading her letter, but now
his usually bright face was clouded with
unmistakable vexation.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mrs. Merryweather, with what
seemed a rather elaborately cheerful expression.
"My letter? It is from Cousin Anna
Belleville. She tells me that Claud has been
with her at Bar Harbor for some time, and
that he is coming to visit us on his way back.
He will be here some day next week, she
thinks."</p>

<p>A certain pensiveness stole over the aspect
of the Merryweathers. Bell and Gertrude
exchanged a swift glance, but said nothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Gerald whistled, "Wrap me up in my tarpaulin
jacket!"</p>

<p>After a brief silence, Mr. Merryweather said,
thoughtfully, "I was thinking of taking the
boys off on a camping trip next week."</p>

<p>"You cannot, Miles," said his wife, quickly.
"It is out of the question."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly," said Mr. Merryweather.
"I only&mdash;a&mdash;quite so!"</p>

<p>He relapsed into inarticulate murmurs over
his pipe. Mrs. Merryweather, after a reproachful
glance at him, turned to Gerald, as
she folded her letter. "You have a letter
from Claud, Gerald?" she asked, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I have, madam," said Gerald, with a brow
of thunder. "He informs me that he is
looking forward with the greatest pleasure
to roughing it a bit with us, and says that
we must make no preparations, but let him
take things just as they are. He's a Christian
soul, that's what he is."</p>

<p>"What is to be the order of the evening?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
asked Mrs. Merryweather, addressing Bell
with a shade of warning in her voice. "Are
we to have games, or boat-building?"</p>

<p>"Oh! boat-building! the regatta is to-morrow,
and we are not half ready."</p>

<p>There was a general rush toward cupboards
and lockers, and in an incredibly short space
of time the whole room was a pleasant litter
of chips, shingles, and brown paper. The rules
for the regattas at Merryweather were few
and simple. All boats must be built by their
owners, unaided; no boat must be over a foot
long from stem to stern; all sails must be of
paper. Aside from these limitations, the
fancies of the campers might roam at will;
accordingly, the boats were of every shape and
description, from Kitty's shingle, ballasted
with pebbles, to Phil's elaborate catamaran.
Peggy was struggling with a stout and somewhat
"nubbly" piece of wood, which was
slowly shaping itself under the vigorous
strokes of her jack-knife.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's coming on!" Peggy declared, cheerfully.
"She really begins to look quite like
a boat now, doesn't she, Mr. Merryweather?"</p>

<p>"Certainly!" the Chief assented. "I don't
see why she should not make a very good
boat, Peggy. I would round off her stern a
bit, if I were you. So! that's better."</p>

<p>"What is her name, Peggy?" inquired
Mrs. Merryweather. "I must be entering the
names in the Log."</p>

<p>"The <i>Lovely Peggy</i>, of course!" said Phil.
"What else should it be?"</p>

<p>"It might be the <i>Limavaddy!</i>" said Gerald.</p>

<p>"Gerald, I <i>wish</i> you would tell me what
you mean by 'Limavaddy,'" said Peggy. "It
sounds like&mdash;I don't know what; tea-caddy,
or something like that. Mrs. Merryweather,
won't you tell me what it means?"</p>

<p>"It is a compliment he is paying you,
Peggy," said her hostess, smiling. "Peg of
Limavaddy is the charming heroine of a charming
ballad of Thackeray's.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>"Wait till to-morrow," cried Peggy, laughing,
"and you'll see whether she floats or not.
And anyhow, she is my first boat. Isn't
there a special class for beginners, Mr. Merryweather?"</p>

<p>"No, no! no fear or favor shown; the rigor
of the game, little Peggy. Margaret, have
you given up?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, please, Mr. Merryweather!" said
Margaret, looking up from her knitting with
a smile. "I could not; it simply was not
possible. Gerald was positive at first that he
could teach me, but after one lesson he was
equally positive that he could not. I needed
no conviction, because I knew I could not."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nobody can do absolutely everything,"
said Gerald, "except the Codger,&mdash;I allude
to my revered uncle, Margaret,&mdash;and I have
at times desired to drown him for that qualification.
You shall be the starter, Margaret;
you'll do that to perfection."</p>

<p>"What are the duties of a starter?" asked
Margaret; "I shall be very glad to do anything
I really can."</p>

<p>"To sit still and look pretty!" said Gerald,
demurely. "I <i>think</i> you can manage it."</p>

<p>"Have I the full list?" asked Mrs. Merryweather.
"I'll read it aloud.</p>

<p>"The <i>Principal Whale</i>,&mdash;Papa."</p>

<p>"I wish you would not call my father
names!" murmured Gerald.</p>

<p>"Jerry, do be still!</p>

<p>"The <i>Tintinnabula</i>, Bell.</p>

<p>"The <i>Jollycumpop</i>, Gertrude.</p>

<p>"The <i>Come-at-a-Body</i>, Gerald.</p>

<p>"The <i>Molasses Cooky</i>, Phil.</p>

<p>"The <i>Polly Cologne</i>, Kitty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"The <i>Whopper</i>, Willy."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"All but Peggy's," said Gertrude. "Peggy,
you must decide on the name of your
boat."</p>

<p>"Oh! Gertrude, that is the hardest part
of all. Margaret, you must name her for
me."</p>

<p>"Why not <i>Semiramis</i>, after the happy
mother of the puppies?" suggested Margaret.</p>

<p>"The whole puppies!" echoed Gerald.
"Don't half name them, Margaret!"</p>

<p>"Why isn't that the name for the boat?"
cried Phil.</p>

<p>"It is! it is!" cried all the rest. "The
<i>Whole Puppy</i>, it is!" And Peggy laughing,
submitted.</p>

<p>"I never <i>was</i> so teased in all my life!"
she said; "but I feel it doing me good."</p>

<p>"That is our one object, my charming
child!" said Gerald, gravely. "We invited
you here in the hope that our united efforts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
might counteract the pernicious influences of
Fernley House."</p>

<p>"Nobody will ever explain to me what a
Come-at-a-Body is!" said Margaret. "Whenever
I ask, you all say, 'Oh, hush! it might
come!' Mrs. Merryweather, won't you tell
me?"</p>

<p>"I will read you the description of it in
the Log," said Mrs. Merryweather, smiling;
"that is the best I can do for you."</p>

<p>She turned over the pages of the book that
lay open in her lap. "Here it is!" she said.
"Now mark and learn, Margaret.</p>

<p>"'The Come-at-a-Body is found only in its
native habitat, where it may be observed at
the proper season, indulging in the peculiar
actions that characterize it. It has more
arms than legs, and more hair than either.
It moves with great rapidity, its gait being
something between a wallop and a waddle;
and as it comes (one of its peculiarities is
that it always comes, and never goes), it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
utters loud screams, and gnashes its teeth in
time with its movements.'</p>

<p>"Now, my dear, you know all that I do!"
Mrs. Merryweather concluded with a candid
smile.</p>

<p>"Thank you so much!" said Margaret,
laughing. "I am certainly enlightened."</p>

<p>At this moment Phil, who was sitting near
the door, laid down his work, and held up a
warning hand. "Hark!" he said. "What
is that?"</p>

<p>"Only the wind!" said some one.</p>

<p>"Or the car rattling o'er the stony street!"
said another.</p>

<p>"No!" said Phil. "I heard a voice, I am
sure. Listen!"</p>

<p>All were silent. Outside the rain was
pouring, the wind wailing in long sighing
gusts; but&mdash;yes! mingling with the wind, a
voice was certainly calling:</p>

<p>"Hallo! hallo, there! Merryweather!"</p>

<p>Gerald sprang to his feet, and struck his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
twin brother on the shoulder. "The Philistines
are upon thee, Samson!" he cried. "I
should know that voice in the shock of spears:
it is Claud Belleville!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<h3>MR. BELLEVILLE</h3>

<span class="caption">&quot;MR. CLAUD <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'BELLVILLE'">BELLEVILLE</ins> WAS A TALL, PALLID YOUTH.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Montforts and Jack Ferrers looked up
with much curiosity and some apprehension
as the twins returned ushering in the unexpected
visitor. Mr. and Mrs. Merryweather
and the girls welcomed him cordially, but
Margaret could not help contrasting their
somewhat subdued cheerfulness with the joyous
outburst that had welcomed herself and
Peggy on their arrival.</p>

<p>Mr. Claud Belleville was a tall, pallid
youth, with blond hair carefully arranged,
pale blue eyes, in one of which an eyeglass
was neatly fitted, and a languid air. He
spoke with a pronounced English accent, and,
on being presented to the other guests, said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
"Oh! very, very, very!" in a most affable
tone.</p>

<p>The Merryweathers bestirred themselves,
some bringing dry garments, some preparing
a hasty meal; the guest meanwhile stood in
the centre of the hearthstone, and adjured
them not to put themselves to inconvenience.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear people, I beg of you!" he
said. "Nothing, positively nothing, but a
biscuit and a cup of tea! Really, now, I
cannot allow it. Thanks, Jerry! awfully
good of you, don't you know! oh! very,
very, very! now, my dear fellow, <i>not</i> your
best coat! It is too absurd."</p>

<p>"It isn't my best, it's my worst!" said
Gerald, bluntly.</p>

<p>"Oh! very good! very diverting! thanks
awfully! don't mention it. Well, Cousin
Miranda, this is charming; this is positively
charming. So delightfully primitive, don't
you know! oh, very, very, very! I told my
people that before I went back to Paris I must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
positively look you up. It is such an age
since I have seen any of you. My little
cousins are all grown up into young ladies,
and such charming young ladies: I congratulate
you, Cousin, <i>de tout mon c&#339;ur!</i>"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Claud!" said Mrs. Merryweather,
quietly. "I trust your mother is
quite well? I only received her note, and
Gerald yours, to-day. She spoke of your
coming next week; if we had known that
you were coming to-night, we would have
sent to the station for you."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes; I knew that!" said Mr. Belleville.
"I know your hospitality never fails,
Cousin Miranda. But you know me, too&mdash;a
butterfly&mdash;here to-day, gone to-morrow! A
summons from the Dunderblincks&mdash;races
going on at their place, don't you know; midsummer
<i>f&ecirc;tes</i>, that sort of thing&mdash;changed
my plans. Mamma said, 'You will have to
give up the Camp, <i>Ch&eacute;ri!</i>' 'No!' I said.
'They expect me; I have passed my word, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
is all I have. I go to the Camp to-day.' I
came&mdash;I saw&mdash;I dare not say I conquered!"
Here he bowed, and threw a killing glance at
Gertrude, who was passing at the moment,
carrying the teapot.</p>

<p>"<i>Can</i> this be the little Gertrude?" he
added, addressing her, and lowering his voice
to a sentimental half-tone. "She has not
forgotten Cousin Claud?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Claud!" replied Gertrude,
smiling. "It is only three years since you
were with us at home for two or three weeks.
I remember you perfectly."</p>

<p>"Only three years!" murmured Mr. Belleville.
"Is it possible? but what momentous
years! The change from the <i>petite fille</i>, the
charming child, to the woman, the&mdash;but I
must not say too much!"</p>

<p>"You'll burn your bloom&mdash;your boots, if
you stand so near the fire!" said Gerald, in
a growl so threatening that Margaret looked
up startled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> boots, dear fellow!" Mr. Belleville
corrected him. "Right! I am a little near
the cheerful blaze. I am a fire-worshipper,
you know; oh, very, very, very!"</p>

<p>"Boys, you'd better see to the boats before
you go to bed!" said Mr. Merryweather,
speaking for the first time since his greeting
of the newcomer.</p>

<p>"All right, sir!" said the twins, rising with
alacrity. "Jack, will you come along?"</p>

<p>"Always thoughtful, Cousin Miles!" said
Mr. Belleville. "Always the prop of the
family! so unchanged!"</p>

<p>Mr. Merryweather's reply was inarticulate,
and its tone caused his wife to begin
hastily a series of inquiries for the visitor's
family.</p>

<p>The twins and Jack Ferrers walked slowly
down the slip in the rain. No one spoke till
they reached the float; then Gerald said
slowly: "Sapolio&mdash;Saccarappa&mdash;Sarcophagus&mdash;<i>Squedunk!</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Feel better?" asked his brother, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"There is one thing," said Gerald, still
speaking slowly and emphatically, "that I
wish, in this connection, distinctly understood.
Indoors he is safe: hospitality&mdash;salt&mdash;Arabs&mdash;that
kind of thing. But if in the immediate
proximity of the cleansing flood"&mdash;he waved
his hand toward the lake&mdash;"he continues to
patronize the parents, in he goes! I have
spoken!"</p>

<p>"I should not presume to restrain my half-hour
elder!" said Phil. "Jack, I'm afraid
we shall have to put this curled darling in
your tent. It's only for the night, fortunately."</p>

<p>"Oh! of course! delighted!" said Jack,
somewhat embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Very, very, very, eh?" said Phil. "Oh!
what's the use of making believe, with any
one we know so well as you? It's a nuisance,
and we don't pretend it isn't."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mark my words, John Ferrers!" broke
in Gerald. "We mean to be civil to this
youth. He is our second cousin, and we
know it. He is also a blooming, blossoming,
burgeoning Ass, and he doesn't know it. They
seldom do. We mean, I say, to be civil to
him, barring patronage of the parents. He
has been our thorn, and we have borne him&mdash;at
intervals, mercifully not too short&mdash;all
our lives. But we aren't going to pretend
that we love him, because we don't. No more
doesn't he love us.</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The love that's lost between us</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Is not the love for me;</span><br />

<p>"Are you ready?" asked the Chief.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, Pater! not just yet. My rudder
has got fouled with the cargo."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Somebody lend me a safety-pin, please!
my mainsail is coming loose."</p>

<p>"Has anybody got any ballast to spare?
just one pebble!"</p>

<p>These cries and many others resounded from
the float, where the campers were gathered,
and were putting the last touches to their
toy boats. Finally Mr. Merryweather declared
that there should be no more delay. The
boats were carefully placed in the Ark, a great
white rowboat manned by the Chief and Phil,
who proceeded to row out leisurely to a white-flagged
buoy at some distance from the shore.
Gerald and Jack in one canoe, Gertrude and
Peggy in another, were stationed at either
side of the course; while Margaret and Claud
Belleville, in a Rangeley boat, were so placed
as to take the time of the various boats as
they came in. This arrangement was not
satisfactory to all the campers, but when protests
were made in the family council the
night before, Mr. Merryweather had calmly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
remarked that it was impossible to please
everybody, and that the visitors should be
given the post of honor. Gerald muttered
that he did not see why Margaret should be
butchered to make a Claudian holiday; to
which his father replied that the matter was
settled, and perhaps he, Gerald, would better
be seeing to the lanterns.</p>

<p>"Aren't you a little hard on the boy?"
asked Mrs. Merryweather, when she and her
husband were left alone together.</p>

<p>"He needs something to bite on!" was the
reply. "He is going through a kind of moral
teething."</p>

<p>This regatta was the first that Margaret
had ever seen, and she was greatly excited.</p>

<p>"Tell us when we are just right!" she
cried to the Chief as she passed the Ark.
"Oh! anchor by the red flag? yes, I remember,
you told me before. Now, Mr.
Belleville, will you throw out the anchor,
please?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Must I?" rejoined Mr. Belleville. "It
seems a pity! So charming to row about a
bit, don't you think? oh! well, if you insist!"&mdash;as
he met Margaret's horrified gaze.
"Here goes!"</p>

<p>The anchor splashed overboard, and the
young man laid down his oars.</p>

<p>"You take this <i>au grand s&eacute;rieux</i>, I see,
Miss Montfort, like my good cousins themselves.
I confess I never can attain their
perennial youthfulness, try how I will. I feel
a Methuselah, I give you my word I do. Oh!
very, very, very!"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," said Margaret,
simply. "We are here to take the time, as
the boats pass the line. There is no other
object in our being here."</p>

<p>"No other? Alas! poor Claud!" sighed
Mr. Belleville. "Now, to me, Miss Montfort,
the sailing of toy boats is the smallest
possible factor in this afternoon's pleasure.
It is not, believe me, the childish sport<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
that I shall remember when I am far
away."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Margaret, vaguely, her eyes
on the white boat.</p>

<p>"You do not ask what it is that I shall
carry with me across the ocean?" Claud's
voice dropped to its favorite smooth half-tone,
what he was fond of describing to his friends
as "<i>ma mi-voix caressante</i>."</p>

<p>"There is a glamour, Miss Montfort, a
magic, that does not always put itself into
words. The perfect day, the perfect vision,
will dwell with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, look!" cried Margaret, starting forward,
eagerly, "they are giving the signal.
Gerald repeats it. Oh, they are off! Look,
look, Mr. Belleville! What a pretty sight."</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a pretty sight. The fairy
fleet started in line, their white and brown
sails taking the breeze gallantly, their prows
(where they had prows) dancing over the
dancing ripples. One or two proved unruly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
turning round and round, and in one case
finally turning bottom side up, with hardly
a struggle. But most of the little vessels
kept fairly well within the course, heading,
more or less, for the shore.</p>

<p>Margaret was enchanted.</p>

<p>"How wonderfully they keep together!"
she said. "Oh! but now they begin to
separate. Look, there is a poor little one
wobbling off all by itself. I wonder&mdash;I am
afraid it is Peggy's. Yes, I am sure it is.
Poor Peggy! Oh! the first three are going
much faster than the rest. I wonder whose
they are. How prettily they sail! Did you
ever see anything prettier?"</p>

<p>"I see something infinitely prettier," said
Mr. Belleville, fixing his eyes on his companion.
But Margaret, wholly unconscious
of his languishing gaze, was watching the
race with an intensity of eagerness that left
no room for any other impressions.</p>

<p>The three forward boats came on swiftly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
their prows dipping lightly, their paper sails
spread full to the breeze. Shouts came ringing
over the water, from the other boats, and
from the shore, where the rest of the campers
were gathered in an excited knot.</p>

<p>"<i>Jollycumpop!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Come-at-a-Body!</i>"</p>

<p>"Good work, <i>Jolly!</i> Keep it up!"</p>

<p>"The <i>Whale</i> is gaining. Hit her up, Spermaceti!"</p>

<p>"<i>Jollycumpop</i> has it! <i>Jollycumpop!</i>"</p>

<p>"The <i>Jolly is</i> first," cried Margaret; "but
the <i>Come-at-a-Body</i> is very, very close. Which
do you think will win, Mr. Belleville?"</p>

<p>"Which do you wish to win?" asked Mr.
Belleville.</p>

<p>"Oh, how can I tell? One is Gertrude's,
the other Gerald's."</p>

<p>"There can be little doubt in that case, I
imagine," said Claud Belleville, with a peculiar
smile. "As a matter of simple gallantry&mdash;dear
me, how unfortunate!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke, his oar slipped from his hand,
and fell with a splash into the water. The
<i>Come-at-a-Body</i> was nearest to the Rangeley
boat. The oar did not absolutely touch the
tiny vessel, but the shock of the disturbed
water was enough to check her gallant progress.
She paused,&mdash;wavered,&mdash;finally recovered
herself, and went bravely on. But
in that pause the <i>Jollycumpop</i> crossed the
line triumphantly, amid loud acclamations.</p>

<p>"The little Gertrude wins!" exclaimed
Mr. Belleville, recovering his oar with graceful
composure. "We can hardly regret an accident
which contributes even slightly to give
the victory where it so manifestly belongs,
can we, Miss Montfort?"</p>

<p>But Margaret Montfort turned upon him,
her fair face flushed with anger, her gentle
eyes full of fire.</p>

<p>"Mr. Belleville, you dropped that oar on
purpose!" she said, quietly.</p>

<p>"How can you suspect me of such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
thing?" replied Mr. Belleville, laughing.
"But, <i>quand m&ecirc;me!</i> would it have been
wholly unjustifiable if I had done so?"</p>

<p>"Wholly, to my mind!" said Margaret.
"In fact, I cannot imagine such a thing being
done by any one who&mdash;" she checked herself.</p>

<p>"By any one who is related to these dear
people?" said Mr. Belleville, lightly. "Ah!
Miss Montfort, a bond of blood does not
always mean a bond of sympathy. These
dear people bore me, and I bore them. Believe
me, it is reciprocal. But do you yourself
never tire of this everlasting childishness,
these <i>jeux d'enfance</i>, on the part of persons
who, after all, are mostly beyond the nursery?"</p>

<p>"I do not!" said Margaret, concisely. "If
you will take in the anchor, Mr. Belleville,
I think I should like to go ashore, if you
please."</p>

<p>"I have offended you!" cried Claud Belleville.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
"You, to whom from the first instant
I have felt so irresistibly drawn. I am unfortunate,
indeed. But you cannot be seriously
angry. Give me a chance to redeem
myself, I implore you, Miss Montfort. See
what a charming little cove opens yonder,
just opposite. Delightful to drift and dream
for an hour, in the company of one who
understands&mdash;oh, very, very, very."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said Margaret,
"and I have no desire to do so, Mr. Belleville.
I beg you to take me ashore at once,&mdash;this
moment."</p>

<p>"And if I were bold enough to delay
obedience for a few moments? If I felt confident
that I could overcome this stern&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gertrude," called Margaret, as the owner
of the victorious <i>Jollycumpop</i> passed them
with a triumphant greeting, "can you give
us a tow?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Gertrude. "Anything
wrong?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the contrary, dear cousin," said Claud,
"I challenge you to a race."</p>

<p>And with a glance at Margaret, half reproachful,
half mocking, he bent to his oars,
with the first sign of energy he had shown
since his arrival.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>PUPPY PLAY</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Bell</span>, may I speak to you a moment?"
said Margaret.</p>

<p>Bell looked up from a critical inspection of
the <i>Tintinnabula</i>, which had been somewhat
injured in the race. "Certainly, May Margaret!"
she said. "Do you want to know
why my poor boatie did not win? I have just
found out." Then, looking up, and seeing
Margaret's disturbed face, she rose instantly.</p>

<p>"Something is wrong?" she said, quickly.
"Come this way, under the trees, where it is
quiet. You have had no bad news, dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Margaret. "But&mdash;Bell,
I have something very disagreeable to tell
you. It seems terrible to say anything that
may make trouble, but nothing makes so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
much trouble as untruth, and I do think you
ought to know this. I don't think the <i>Jollycumpop</i>
really won the race!"</p>

<p>"My dear Margaret! she came in well
ahead; didn't you see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen, Bell!" and Margaret told in a
few words the story of the dropped oar.</p>

<p>Bell listened with keen attention, and when
Margaret had finished, whistled two bars of
the Siegfried <i>motif</i> very correctly before she
spoke.</p>

<p>"The little animal!" she said at last.
"Well, Margaret, do you know, the best
thing to do, in my opinion, is&mdash;to say nothing
about it, at present."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Bell! Gerald really won!"</p>

<p>"I know! but, even as it is, Jerry can
hardly keep his hands off Claud. My one
prayer is that we may be able to get the boy
off to-morrow without an open quarrel breaking
out. You see, Margaret, when they were
little, it was all right for Jerry to thrash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
him. He did it punctually and thoroughly,
every time they met, and it was very good
for the boy; but now of course it is out of
the question."</p>

<p>"Why did he come here?" inquired Margaret.
"Did ever any one manage to make
so much trouble in so short a time? the very
air seems changed."</p>

<p>Bell shrugged her shoulders. "His mother
made him come, probably," she said. "He
is really devoted to his mother; when you
see him with her, you forgive a great deal.
She is very fond of my father, and is always
hoping that he may be able to influence
Claud, and to appreciate him. After all,
the boy has no father, and he has been systematically
spoiled ever since he was born.
I wish to-morrow were over."</p>

<p>"Then," said Margaret, slowly, "I am to
say nothing about this matter."</p>

<p>"Please not!" said her friend. "My dear,
I see you are troubled, because you saw the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
horrid thing done; and you don't think it
right to conceal the truth, even for a time.
I am just as angry as you, but remember,
there is 'a time to speak and a time to be
silent.' This is a time to be silent, I am
very sure; if we were to tell the boys now, it
would be a match thrown into a powder-magazine.
To-morrow, when Claud is safely off
to his Dunderblincks, we will tell them; there
will be an explosion then, but it will do no
harm; and in a day or two the two boats can
have a race by themselves, and that will decide
the case. Are you convinced, Justitia?"</p>

<p>"Entirely!" said Margaret. "You are
very wise, Bell; I suppose I was too angry to
see clearly; I have never been so angry in
my life. As you say, I suppose it is because
I saw it; and it <i>was</i> a horrid thing to see. I
too wish to-morrow were over."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The morrow came, and the morning passed
peacefully enough. The wagon was ordered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
which was to carry the visitor to the evening
train. The elders began to breathe freely,
and it was with a mind comparatively at rest
that Mr. Merryweather strolled down to the
float after dinner, to inspect a boat which had
been hauled up for repairs. The other "menfolks"
of the family followed him, and all
stood round after the fashion of their kind,
saying little, but enjoying themselves in their
own way.</p>

<p>"I'd caulk her a bit, Jerry," said the
Chief; "and then give her a couple of coats
of shellac. She'll do then for the rest of the
season."</p>

<p>"All right, Pater!" said Jerry.</p>

<p>"And if it be possible," his father went
on, "so far as in you lies, do not spill
the shellac about. Shellac is an excellent
thing in its place, but I don't like it on
the seat of my chair, where I found it
this morning, nor sprinkled over the new
'Century,' as it was last night. And it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
isn't as if there were any to spare; the can
is very low."</p>

<p>"I know!" said Gerald, penitently. "I
am awfully sorry, Pater. I threw a cushion
at Fergs, and it upset the can. I scraped up
as much as I could; I think there is enough
left for this job. If not, would that varnish
do?"</p>

<p>"Varnish&mdash;" said Mr. Merryweather; and
he plunged into a dissertation upon the abominations
of most varnishes and the iniquities
of their makers. Gerald replied, defending
certain kinds for certain purposes; the others
chimed in, and a heated discussion was going
on, when Claud Belleville joined the party.
In spotless gray tweeds, with a white Manila
hat and a lavender necktie, he made a singular
contrast to the campers in their flannel
shirts and dingy corduroys.</p>

<p>At his appearance, Gerald rose from his
squatting posture at the stern of the boat,
while Phil and Jack amiably made way for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the newcomer at the edge of the wharf, where,
for some unexplained reason, men always like
to stand. Claud, finding himself between
Gerald and his father, turned toward the
latter with an air of cheerful benevolence.</p>

<p>"Cousin Miles," he said, "you must promise
me, you really must, to come to us at Bar
Harbor before the end of the summer. I
gave my word to Mamma that I would induce
you to come. She longs to see you."</p>

<p>"I should like very much to see her," said
Mr. Merryweather. "We were always very
good friends, your mother and I. Give her
my love, and tell her that some time when she
is in New York I shall run on to see her;
possibly this autumn, before you sail. It
would not be possible for me to leave here
now."</p>

<p>"Oh, but yes!" cried Mr. Belleville, airily.
"It could be possible, Cousin Miles. Here are
the boys, absolutely <i>au fait</i> in bog-trotting of
every description; in fact, suited to the life&mdash;in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
all its aspects." He swept Gerald with
a comprehensive glance, from his mop of red
hair, tanned into rust-color, to his feet, clad in
superannuated "sneakers."</p>

<p>"They can do all the honors of the place as
they should be done," he added. "But you,
Cousin Miles, you must positively come to
Bar Harbor. You live too much the life of
the fields. Mamma is constantly deploring
it. We will show you a little life, Mamma
and I. I will put you up at my Club, and
take you out in my new auto; in a week, you
will not know yourself, I give you my word.
Oh, very, very, very!"</p>

<p>As the speaker stood beaming benevolence
at Mr. Merryweather, and diffusing contempt
among the rest of the party, two hands were
laid on his shoulders; hands which gripped
like steel, and propelled him forward with
irresistible force. He staggered, struggled to
save himself&mdash;and the next instant disappeared
with a loud splash beneath the water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Gerald confronted his father with a face of
white fire.</p>

<p>"I told him, sir, plainly and distinctly,
that if he patronized you I should duck him!"
he said. "He has had fair warning: this
has gone on long enough."</p>

<p>"Gerald," said Mr. Merryweather, gravely,
"you are behaving like a foolish and ill-tempered
child. I am fully able to take care
of myself. We will talk of this later. Meantime
you will apologize to your cousin."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, sir! I intended to, of
course."</p>

<p>While this brief colloquy had been going
on, Phil and Jack, with sparkling eyes, waited
at the edge of the wharf for the reappearance
of Mr. Belleville. Up he came presently,
splashing and sputtering, his eyes flashing
angry sparks. Phil held out a hand; a
vigorous pull, a scramble, and he stood once
more on the wharf. Gerald walked up to
him at once. "I beg your pardon, Claud!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
he said. "I had no business to do it, and
I apologize."</p>

<p>Claud gave a spiteful laugh, and shook
himself in his cousin's direction, spattering
him with drops. "Don't mention it, dear
fellow!" he said, through his chattering teeth.
"It serves me right for expecting civilized
manners in the backwoods. This no doubt
appears to you an exquisite pleasantry, and its
delicacy will be appreciated, no doubt, by
others of your circle. <i>Enfin</i>, in the presence
of your father, whom I respect, I can but
accept your apology. Since you are sorry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did not say I was sorry!" Gerald broke
in. "I said I begged your pardon."</p>

<p>"My son, will you go at once and attend
to the fire?" said Mr. Merryweather.</p>

<p>"Father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>At once!</i>" repeated Mr. Merryweather.</p>

<p>Gerald went.</p>

<p>"Phil, take your cousin in, and get him
some dry clothes. His own will be dry before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the wagon comes, if you hang them by the
kitchen stove. Hurry now!"</p>

<p>Phil and Claud went off in surly silence,
and Mr. Merryweather turned to Jack Ferrers,
who had remained an amused but somewhat
embarrassed spectator of the scene.</p>

<p>"Puppy play, Jack!" he said, quietly.
"You have seen plenty of it in Germany.
One puppy <i>is</i> a puppy, more's the pity, and
the other has red hair. Well! well! I did
hope this could have been avoided; but we
must not let it go any further. I wish Roger
were here. I wonder if you can help me out,
Jack."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best, sir!" said Jack, heartily.</p>

<p>"You see, I must go off; I ought to be at
the village landing this moment, to see about
that freight that is coming. Do you think
you can keep the peace till I come back?"</p>

<p>"I think I can," said Jack. "I'll make
a good try for it, anyhow, Mr. Merryweather."</p>

<p>"That's a good lad!" said the Chief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
"You could knock both their heads together,
if you put your mind&mdash;and your biceps&mdash;to
it; but I hope that will not be necessary. In
any case, don't let them fight! I promised
his mother."</p>

<p>He nodded, and, settling himself in a boat,
departed with long, powerful strokes.</p>

<p>Jack, left alone, shook his curly head, and
felt of his arms.</p>

<p>"Ah'm fit!" he said, quoting another and
a bigger Jock than himself. "But it's a pity.
That fellow is not only a puppy, he is a cur.
I never saw anybody who needed a thrashing
more." And he went and coiled himself in a
hammock, and prepared to keep watch.</p>

<p>An hour later Mr. Claud Belleville, once
more dry, if somewhat shorn of his glory,
reappeared upon the scene. As he came out
of his tent, Gerald strolled carelessly out of the
boat-house, his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>"Cousin Rowdy, a word with you, if you
please!" said Claud.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cousin Cad, two, if you like!" said
Gerald.</p>

<p>"In France, where I live," Mr. Belleville
resumed, "when we are insulted, we fight."</p>

<p>"No! do you really?" cried Gerald, his
eyes sparkling as he began eagerly to turn
back his cuffs. "Hooray! I say, shake hands,
Claud. I didn't think you had it in you.
There's a bully place up behind the woodshed.
Come on!"</p>

<p>Claud Belleville, who really was no coward,
started forward readily: but at this moment
Destiny intervened, in the shape of six foot
four of John Ferrers. Uncoiling his length
from the hammock, he took two strides forward,
and lifting Gerald in his arms as if he
were an infant, carried him off bodily. Gerald,
who was strong and agile as a young panther,
fought and struggled, pouring out a torrent of
angry protest; but in vain. When Jack put
forth his full strength, there was no possibility
of resistance. He bore the furious lad to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
tent, and throwing him on the cot, deliberately
sat down on his feet, in calm and cheerful
silence. Gerald twisted and writhed, exhausted
himself in struggles, threats, prayers;
all in vain! Jack sat like a statue. Finally
the boy relapsed into sullen silence, and lay
panting, his hand clenched, his blue eyes dark
with anger and chagrin.</p>

<p>By and by came the sound of wheels; a
wagon stopped in front of the camp. There
were sounds of leave-taking; "Good-by,
Claud!" "Our love to your mother!" in various
tones and modulations; then the sound
of wheels once more, rattling up the hill and
away in the distance. Then Jack Ferrers
rose, and smiled down on his prostrate
friend.</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry, old man!" he said.</p>

<p>Gerald was silent.</p>

<p>"Jerry! you're not going to cut up
rough?"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say," said Gerald, coldly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are my guest, and manners forbid. We
will change the subject, if you please."</p>

<p>"Manners didn't forbid your chucking the
Charmer into the drink!" said Jack. "Ho!
did you see him blink when he came up? It
was worth while, Jerry, even if I have to
fight you, but I don't believe I shall. You
see, your father had to go off, and he asked
me to keep the peace, and I said I would;
and I didn't see any other way, wildcat that
you are. A sweet condition the Charmer
would have been in to go back to his Mamma,
if I had not done as I did!"</p>

<p>"I might have known the Pater was at the
bottom of it!" said Gerald, his face lightening,
and his voice taking on its own kindly
ring. "Fine man; but the extent to which
he won't let me thrash Claud is simply
disgusting. When it comes to setting a Megatherium
on a man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And to the Megatherium sitting on the
man&mdash;" said Jack, laughing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"No more o' that, Jack, if thou love me!
There's the horn! Come on, and let that
flint-hearted parent see that we are all right."</p>

<p>The pair strolled in to supper, arm in arm,
singing, to the tune of "Home, Sweet Home!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>MRS. MERRYWEATHER'S VIGIL</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Merryweather</span> had had a busy day.
There had been a picnic at Oak Island, which
had taken all the morning and a good part of
the afternoon; then there had been a dozen
letters to write for the late mail; and finally
she had taken Kitty's turn with Willy at
getting supper, as Kitty had a headache.
The sisters protested, each one claiming her
right to take the extra duty; but Mrs. Merryweather
had her own reasons for being glad
of the hour of play-work with her little boy.
Willy had been rather out of spirits, which
meant that he, as well as his sister, had eaten
too many huckleberries; this afternoon he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
had been decidedly cross, and required treatment.</p>

<p>Coming into the kitchen at five o'clock,
she found the fire lighted, and the kettle on,
for Willy was a faithful soul; but he was
frowning heavily over his chopping-tray.</p>

<p>"I wish mince-meat had never been invented!"
he said, gloomily.</p>

<p>"Do you?" said his mother. "I don't!
I am glad it was, even if I did not have three
helps last night."</p>

<p>"I was so hungry, I had to eat something,"
said Willy, in an injured tone. "When I
grow up, I mean to have beefsteak every
day, and never have anything made over
at all."</p>

<p>"I'll remember that, the next time we have
brown-bread brewis!" said his mother smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh! that's different!" said Willy.</p>

<p>"Most things are different," said Mrs.
Merryweather, "if you look at them in a
different way. Is that ready, son?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"As ready as it is ever going to be. I've
chopped till my arm is almost broken."</p>

<p>"So I see! It looks as if you had cracked it.
Well, now, it isn't time yet to make the rolls,
so we can take breath a bit. Come out on
the porch, and let us play something till the
kettle boils."</p>

<p>"I don't feel like playing!" said Willy,
dolefully; "I don't feel like doing anything,
Mammy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Merryweather looked at him a moment;
then taking his hands in hers, she said
suddenly, "'For heaven's sake let us sit upon
the ground, and tell sad stories of the death
of kings!' That is a passage from Richard
II., and it seems to fit the occasion. Sit down,
Willy; right here on the floor by me; I'll
begin. Two minutes for composition!"</p>

<p>She was silent, looking out over the water,
while Willy glanced sidewise at her, half-interested
in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"I have it!" she said, presently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your turn, Willy! two minutes!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mammy, I can't play!"</p>

<p>"But you <i>are</i> playing. Only one minute

<p>"Well, then&mdash;does it have to be the real
way they died? because I don't know."</p>

<p>"I think it's bully. Did you really just

</div>

<p>Willy's gloom was effectually banished, and
he continued to slaughter kings till the supper-horn
blew.</p>

<p>The effect of this and other mental exercises,
added to a cup of tea, was such that when bed-time
came, Mrs. Merryweather found herself
singularly wide awake. In vain she counted
hundreds; in vain she ransacked her memory
for saints, kings, and cities alphabetically
arranged; in vain she made a list of Johns,
beginning with the Baptist and ending with
John O'Groats; the second hundred found
her wider awake than ever, as she tossed on
her narrow cot. Mr. Merryweather, in the
opposite cot, was breathing deep and regularly;
he was sound asleep, at least, and that
was a good thing. Other than this, no sound
broke the perfect stillness of the night. The
full moon rode high, and lake and woodland<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
were flooded with silver light. A glorious
night! Mrs. Merryweather sighed; what
was the use of staying in bed on such a
night as this, when one could not sleep? If
only there were some excuse for getting up!</p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered that, the night
being very warm, and the two children apparently
entirely recovered from their slight indisposition,
they had been allowed to sleep out
on the Point, in accordance with a promise
made some days ago by their father. She
had not been quite willing, but had yielded
to pressure, and they had gone out, very
happy, with their blankets and the india-rubber
floor-cloth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Merryweather sat up in bed. "I ought
to go and see if those chicks are all right!"
she said. "After all, they certainly were not
quite well this afternoon, whatever Miles may
say." She glanced half-defiantly at the other
cot, but Miles said nothing. She rose quietly,
put on wrapper and slippers, and opening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
noiselessly the screen-door of the tent, slipped
out into the open, and stood for a moment
looking about her. How beautiful it was!
what a wonderful silver world! Sleep was
good, but surely, to be awake, on such a night
as this, was better.</p>

<p>She stole past the other tents, pausing an
instant at the door of each to listen for the
regular breathing which is the sweetest music
a mother can hear; then she made her way
out to the Point, through the sweet tangle of
fern and berry-bushes, under the bending trees
that dropped dew on her head as she passed.</p>

<p>The Point lay like the prow of some great
vessel in a silver sea. One tall pine stood for
the mast; under this pine, rolled in scarlet
blankets, their rosy faces turned toward the
moon, lay the children, sound asleep. Willy
had curled one arm under his head, and his
other hand was locked in his sister's.</p>

<p>"Dear little things!" murmured their
mother. "That means that Kitty-my-pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
was a little bit frightened before she went to
sleep. Dear little things!"</p>

<p>She stood there for some time looking down
at them.</p>

<p>"The moon is full on their faces!" she
said. "My old nurse would tell me that they
would be moonstruck 'for sartain sure!'
How terrified I used to be, lest a ray of
moonlight should shine on my bed, and I
should wake a lunatic!"</p>

<p>She glanced up at the moon; looked again,
and yet again. "That is very singular!"
said Mrs. Merryweather. "Something seems
to be happening to the moon."</p>

<p>Something <i>was</i> happening to the moon. It
was as if a piece had been bitten out of the
shining round. Was it a little cloud? no!
no cloud could possibly look like that, so
black, so thick, so&mdash;"Good gracious!"
said Mrs. Merryweather; "it is an eclipse!"</p>

<p>An eclipse it certainly was. Slowly, surely,
the black shadow crept, crept, over the silver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
disk; now a quarter of its surface was hidden;
now it went creeping, creeping on
toward the half.</p>

<p>"It is going to be a total eclipse!" said
Mrs. Merryweather. "I suppose I ought to
wake some of them."</p>

<p>She stood a moment more, looking irresolutely
at the sleeping children. "I cannot
possibly wake them!" she said at last.
"Little lambs! they are sleeping so beautifully,
and they certainly were <i>not</i> quite themselves
this afternoon. Besides, there will be
plenty more eclipses; I'll go and wake some
of the others."</p>

<p>The black shadow crept on. Hardly less
silent, Mrs. Merryweather paused before the
tent where her daughters slept. Bell and
Gertrude scorned cots, and their mattresses
were spread on the floor at night, and rolled
up in the daytime. There the two girls lay,
still and placid, statue-like, save for the
gentle heaving of their quiet breasts. A fair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
picture for a mother to look on. Miranda
Merryweather looked, and drew a happy
breath; looked again, and shook her head.
"I cannot wake them!" she murmured to
herself. "They are both tired after that expedition;
Bell paddled very hard on the way
back; she was much more flushed than I like
to see her, when she came in. And Gertrude
sleeps so lightly, I fear she might not get to
sleep again if I were to wake her now."</p>

<p>The black shadow crept on; the mother
crept into the boys' tent, and stood beside
Gerald's cot. The lad lay with his arms flung
wide apart; his curly hair was tossed over
his broad open forehead; his clear-cut features
were set as if in marble.</p>

<p>"He has such a beautiful forehead!" said
Mrs. Merryweather. "He sleeps so very
sound, that if I were to wake him he might
not be able to sleep again. Dear Jerry!"</p>

<p>She moved over to Phil's cot: Phil was
uneasy, and as she stopped to straighten the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
bedclothes, he turned on his side, muttering
something that sounded like "Bother breakfast!"</p>

<p>"Poor laddie!" said Mrs. Merryweather.
"He looks as if he might have a headache.
I wish I had made him take a nice little cup
of hot malted milk before he went to bed. It
is out of the question to wake him, when
he is sleeping so uneasily."</p>

<p>She left the tent, with hardly a glance
toward Jack Ferrers, who lay in the farthest
cot. The idea of waking him, and having
him disturb her own boys, was too preposterous
to be entertained for an instant.</p>

<p>The black shadow had crept entirely over
the moon; no silver disk now, only a shield
of dull bronze; "like some of the Pompeiian
bronzes!" Mrs. Merryweather thought. "It
is very extraordinary. I suppose I really
<i>ought</i> to wake Miles."</p>

<p>She entered her own tent, and stood by
her husband's cot. Miles Merryweather was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
sleeping quite as soundly as any of his children;
in fact, he was a very statue of sleep;
but his wife laid her hand gently on his
shoulder. "Miles!" she said; it must be
confessed that she did not speak very loud.
"Miles, there is an eclipse!"</p>

<p>Mr. Merryweather did not stir.</p>

<p>"Miles! do you want to wake up?"</p>

<p>No reply; no motion of the long, still form.
Mrs. Merryweather breathed more freely.
"Miles was more tired to-night than I have
seen him all summer!" she said. "He cannot
remember that we are not twenty-five any
more. It is very bad for a man to get overtired
when he is no longer young. Well, I
certainly did try to wake him; but such a
<i>very</i> sound sleep as this shows how much he
needed it. I am sure it is much more important
for him to sleep than to see the eclipse;
it isn't as if he had not seen plenty of eclipses
in his life. Of course, if it had been the sun,
it would have been different."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>She stood at the door of the tent, watching.
Slowly, slowly, the black shadow passed;
slowly, slowly, the silver crescent widened to a
broad arc, and finally to the perfect argent
round; once more the whole world lay bathed
in silver light. Mrs. Merryweather gazed on
peacefully, and murmured under her breath
certain words that she loved:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Queen and huntress, chaste and fair,<br />

<p>"But if Roger had been here," said Miranda
Merryweather, "I should certainly have waked
him, because he is a scientific man, and it
would have been only right!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"A wet sheet and a flowing sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A wind that follows fast&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Phil Merryweather</span> was singing as he
brought his boat about. "Slacken your sheet,
Peggy! easy&mdash;that's right! a half-hitch&mdash;look
here, young lady! I believe you
have been humbugging us all; don't tell me
you never sailed a boat before!"</p>

<p>"Never in all my life!" said Peggy, looking
up joyously. "I have only dreamed of it
and thought about it, ever since I can remember.
And I have read the 'Seaman's Friend,'
and 'Two Years Before the Mast,' so I do
know a little bit about how things ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
go. I think every girl ought to learn how
to sail a boat, if she possibly can; but out on
the ranch, you see, there really wasn't any
chance. We could only make believe, but we
used to have great fun doing that."</p>

<p>"How did you make your believe? I should
like to hear about it. Ease her off a bit&mdash;so&mdash;as
you are!"</p>

<p>"Why, we made a boat out of the great
swing in the barn. It is a huge barn, and
the swing is big enough for three elephants to
swing on at once; and Hugh fastened hammocks
along it lengthwise, and then rigged
ropes and pulleys for us, and an old canvas
hammock with the ends cut off for a sail; so
we swung, and called it sailing, and had
storms and shipwrecks, and all kinds of
adventures. It was great fun. Oh, I do wish
some of you could come out to the ranch some
day. If there was only water, it would be
the best place in the world&mdash;except this and
Fernley."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm coming some day!" said Phil. "See
if I don't. It must be corking sport, riding
about over those great plains."</p>

<p>"Oh! it is!" cried Peggy. "When you
come, Phil, you shall ride Monte. He is the
most beautiful creature, a Spanish jennet.
Jack Del Monte sent him to brother Jim, but
he isn't up to Jim's weight, so he lets me ride
him. He is like the horses in poetry, that is
the only way I can describe him; white as
milk, with great dark eyes, and graceful&mdash;oh,
I <i>do</i> want you to see him. No horse in
poetry was ever half so beautiful; in fact, I
think I take back what I said; I don't really
think poets know much about horses; do
you?"</p>

<p>"'Zebra-footed, ostrich-thighed,'" quoted
Phil, laughing.</p>

<p>"I know!" said Peggy, indignantly. "Now,
the idea, Phil! one thinks of a poor dear horse
all over ostrich feathers behind, which is dreadful.
But then, I don't understand poetry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
except about battles, Macaulay and Scott.
Don't you love 'Marmion'?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do!" said Phil, heartily. "Hi!"</p>

<p>This last brief exclamation was made in a
tone of some concern.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Peggy. "Am I trimming
wrong?"</p>

<p>"Right as a trivet! but&mdash;have you ever
heard of a williwaw, Peggy?"</p>

<p>"It's a squall, isn't it? Captain Slocum
tells about them in 'Sailing Alone Round the
World.'"</p>

<p>"That's it! Well, I think we are going to
get one. If you will take the helm again for
a moment, I'll take in a reef."</p>

<p>Peggy took the tiller in her strong little
brown hand, and looked on admiringly while
Phil reefed the sail with creditable swiftness.
Soon all was tight, and the two young people
watched with cheerful interest the coming on
of the squall.</p>

<p>On it came, a line of white on the water, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
gray curtain of driving rain above it. The
wind began to sing in the rigging of the
sailboat; next moment she heeled heavily
over, and sped along with her lee rail under
water.</p>

<p>"I'd sit pretty well up to windward if I
were you," shouted Phil. "You'll be dryest
on the gunwale, if you don't mind!"</p>

<p>As Peggy seated herself with alacrity on
the gunwale, Phil looked at her with approval.
Her eyes were shining, her whole rosy face
alight with happy excitement.</p>

<p>"Now, that's the kind of girl I like to see!"
said this young gentleman, forgetting that he
had been seeing three of the same kind ever
since he could remember; but sisters are
different!</p>

<p>"Not so bad, eh?" he said, as he took
another turn on the sheet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Phil, it is perfectly splendid! why,
we are simply flying! Oh, I wish it was like
this all the time."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hi!" said Phil again. "Everybody doesn't
seem to be of your opinion, Peggy. That boat
over there will be in trouble if she doesn't
look out. Sapolio! there is something wrong.
We'd better run over and see."</p>

<p>At a little distance a small boat was tossing
violently on the water; her sail was lowered,
and a white handkerchief was fluttering from
the stern like a signal of distress.</p>

<p>"Ready about!" said Phil. Peggy crouched
down on the seat, the boom swung over, and
the gallant little <i>Petrel</i> flew swiftly as her
namesake to the rescue.</p>

<p>"Anything wrong?" asked Phil, as he
ran alongside the crippled boat.</p>

<p>"Broke our rudder!" was the reply, from
a pleasant-looking lad; "must have been
cracked before we started. If you could lend
us a pair of oars&mdash;I was very stupid to come
out without a pair&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment a clear, shrill voice was
heard above the noise of wind and water, crying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
aloud, "My Veezy Vee! my Veezy Vee!
It <i>is</i> my Veezy Vee! Don't tell me it isn't, for
it simply <i>is!</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Viola!</i>" cried Peggy. "Vanity! can it
be you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear! I was once, perhaps, but
with all my crimps out, how can you have the
heart? If ever I get ashore alive,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be ridiculous, Viola!" said the lad,
in a tone of brotherly tolerance. "You are in
no more danger&mdash;now&mdash;then if you were
in bed. Though I admit it might have been
rather fussy if we hadn't met you!" he added,
with a meaning look at Phil.</p>

<p>"How far have you to go?" asked Phil.
"Buffum's Point? Well, now, look here! that
will be a long, hard pull against this wind.
You'd much better let us tow you down to our
camp, and then you can ship a new rudder,
and go home any old time when the wind sets
right."</p>

<p>The young man hesitated. "Why&mdash;you're<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
awfully good," he said, "but I think we'd
better get home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, do, <i>do</i> let us go, Tom!" cried the
pretty girl who had waved the handkerchief,
and who seemed still, somehow, to be waving
everything about her. "No, I won't be quiet!
It's my Veezy Vee, I tell you; it's Peggy
Montfort, and I am simply expiring to talk to
her. Besides, if I am going to be drowned, I
want to be drowned with another girl. Oh,
Peggy, isn't it dreadful? Do you think we
shall ever get home alive?"</p>

<p>Here the wind caught her hat, and in a
frantic effort to retain it, she very nearly fell
overboard. "There!" she cried. "I told
you so, Tommy; I knew I should be drowned."</p>

<p>"I never said you wouldn't," replied her
brother, with some heat, "if you play such
pranks as that. You simply <i>must</i> sit still,
Vi!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all very well to say I must sit
still, Tommy Vincent. If <i>you</i> had a hat that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
was the pride of your life, instead of a felt
saucepan, perhaps you wouldn't want to have
it carried off and drowned before your eyes.
My precious hatty!"</p>

<p>"Why, we are all right, Viola," said Peggy.
"It is perfectly splendid, I think. Besides,
the worst of it is past. Look! the sky is
lightening already; the whole thing will be
over soon."</p>

<p>"But I am drenched to the skin!" cried
poor Viola. "The rain has gone through and
wet my poor bones, I know it has; I shall
<i>never</i> be dry again, I am convinced, never:
there isn't a school-book in the world dry
enough to dry me, Peggy, not even Hallam's
'Middle Ages.'"</p>

<p>"Pooh! who cares for a wetting?" said
Peggy, shaking herself like a Newfoundland
dog. "It only adds to the fun."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's all very well for you, Veezy
Vee!" cried poor Viola. "But if <i>you</i> had
on a silk waist, you would feel differently, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
know you would. And my hat simply <i>was</i> the
sweetest thing you ever saw; wasn't it, Tom?
Sugar was salt beside it; wasn't it, Tom?"</p>

<p>Tom, who had been holding a consultation
with Phil over the broken rudder, answered
by a brief, though not unfriendly growl, and
paid no further attention to her. The painter
of his boat was made fast to the <i>Petrel's</i> stern,
and the latter was soon winging her way
toward the Camp, towing the disabled boat
behind her.</p>

<p>"Aren't you Vincent of 1903?" asked Phil,
leaning over the stern, his hand on the tiller
and one eye on the clouds. "Thought so!
Used to see you about the yard. My name is
Merryweather; 1902."</p>

<p>"Glad to know you!" said Tom Vincent.
"I thought it must be you; I used to see you
rowing, of course. Your brother&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by excited squeaks from
his sister, who was gazing at Phil with sparkling
eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"No!" she cried. "It <i>can't</i> be! It would
be <i>too</i> delicious! <i>not</i> Merryweather! Don't
ask me to believe it, Peggy, for it simply
is beyond my powers. <i>Not</i> the Snowy's
brother!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" said Peggy, laughing as she,
too, leaned back over the stern. "Let me
introduce you; Mr. Philip Merryweather,
Miss Viola Vincent."</p>

<p>"Awfully glad!" said Phil, making a motion
toward where his hat should have been.
"I've often heard my sister speak of you,
Miss Vincent."</p>

<p>"Oh! Mr. Merryweather, I <i>adore</i> the
Snowy!" cried Viola. "She is simply the
dearest creature on the face of the earth. I
would give the wide world&mdash;I would give
my very best frill to see her. Don't tell me
she is near here, for I should expire with joy;
simply expire!"</p>

<p>"I certainly will not," said Phil, smiling,
"if the consequences would really be so terrible,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Miss Vincent. Otherwise, I might venture
to predict that you would see her in about ten
minutes. If you feel any untoward symptoms
developing, please consider it unsaid!"</p>

<p>"Oh! Tom, isn't it <i>too</i> thrilling?" cried
Viola. "Oh! Tom, aren't you perfectly <i>rigid</i>
with excitement? It makes Tom rigid, Mr.
Merryweather, and it makes me flutter; we
are so different. <i>Aren't</i> you rigid, Tommy?"</p>

<p>"Viola, don't be a goose!" said her brother,
good-naturedly. "I am not in the least rigid,
though I shall be delighted to see Miss Merryweather,
of course."</p>

<p>"You can see the camp now, through the
trees," said Phil. "There is the flag, just
over that tall pine. Flag by day; lantern by
night. That is 'Merryweather.' Ready
about, Peggy, for the last tack!"</p>

<p>The squall had passed, and though the
water was still rough, the waves were tossing
merrily in blue and white under a brilliant
sun. The <i>Petrel</i> sped along, the silver foam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
bubbling up before her prow, and the <i>Seamew</i>,
as the other boat was named, followed as
swiftly.</p>

<p>Peggy leaned back over the stern once
more, and holding out her hand to her old
schoolmate, gave her slender fingers a squeeze
that made her cry out.</p>

<p>"Dear old Vanity," said Peggy; "I forgot
how soft your hands always were. But I
am so glad to see you, even if I am not
going to expire about it. Do tell me how
you came here, and where you are staying,
and all about it, now that we can hear ourselves
speak."</p>

<p>"How did I come here, my dear?" repeated
Viola Vincent. "Witchcraft!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, you foolish thing?"</p>

<p>"My dear, what I say; simply that and nothing
more, just like the Raven. Witchcraft!
The very minute I get home, I am going to get
a pointed black hat and a red cloak, and a
crutch-stick. I think they will be quite sweet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
don't you? Don't you think pointed hats are
quite sweet, Mr. Merryweather?"</p>

<p>"Pointed hats," replied Phil, gravely, "have
always seemed to me the acme of sweetness;
that is why they call them sugar-loaf hats, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Oh! Mr. Merryweather, you <i>are</i> funny!
Oh, I <i>hoped</i> you were going to be funny,"
cried Viola; "you <i>look</i> funny, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said Phil; and "Viola,
don't be a goose!" said her brother again.</p>

<p>"I mean it as a compliment!" cried Viola.
"Mr. Merryweather, I mean it as the very
highest compliment I can pay, I truly do.
With such a simply entrancing name as
Merryweather, it would be such a dreadful
pity to be sober as a judge, you know;
though the only judge I know is too frisky
for anything. Kittens, my dear, I&mdash;I mean,
Mr. Merryweather&mdash;I <i>beg</i> your pardon! are
actually <i>grim</i> beside Judge Gay; aren't they,
Tommy? Did you ever see a grim kitten,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Mr. Merryweather? Wouldn't it be too horrid
for anything? Well, but what I meant
to say is, the only weeniest speck of a fault I
ever had to find with the Snowy&mdash;darling
thing!&mdash;was that she was a little bit&mdash;just
the tiniest winiest scrap&mdash;too serious. If
your name were Tombs, you know, or Graves,
or Scull,&mdash;I knew a girl named Scull,&mdash;of
course you would have to <i>be</i> serious to live up
to it; but when your name is Merryweather,
you ought to live up to <i>that</i>, and so I always
told the Snowy."</p>

<p>"I am sure the Snowy was always jolly
enough," said Peggy, bluntly, "except when
you wanted to get into mischief, Vanity!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I <i>always</i> wanted to get into mischief,"
replied Viola; "so that made it a
little hard for me, Peggy, you must admit it
did, especially when I adored the Snowy, and
couldn't bear to have her look grave at me.
Mr. Merryweather, when the Snowy looked
<i>really</i> grave at me, it froze my young blood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
just like Hamlet's; didn't it, Peggy? I used
to go and sit on the radiator to get thawed
out, didn't I, Peggy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," said Peggy, laughing.
"But all this time, Vanity, we have not
heard about the witchcraft that brought you
to this part of the world."</p>

<p>"Oh! so you haven't. Well, now you
shall. You see I am eighteen this summer,
so Puppa said I should choose where we
should go, whether to the mountains, or to
Newport, or to this lake, where he knew of a
camp he could have. So I thought I would
say Newport, on account of my new frills; I
had some perfectly heavenly new frills, and
of course Newport is the best place to show
them. But just as I was going to <i>say</i> 'Newport,'
<i>something</i> made me turn right round
and say to come here. I supposed it was
partly because of course I knew Puppa hated
Newport, and he is such a perfect duck about
going there; but now I know that it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
witchcraft, and something inside me, black
cats or something, made me know, without
knowing anything about it, that you and the
Snowy were going to be here, Peggy. So
now I am perfectly happy! Oh! Oh! Why,
there <i>is</i> the Snowy! Oh, Snowy, you darling!
It's me! It's Vanity! How <i>do</i> you
do? Isn't this <i>too</i> perfectly entrancing for
anything!"</p>

<p>With a graceful turn, Phil brought his
boat alongside the wharf, where a group of
campers, Gertrude among them, were gathered
to receive them. Gertrude had Viola in her
arms in a moment, and was welcoming her
with a warmth that made the emotional little
creature sob with real pleasure and affection.</p>

<p>"Oh, Snowy!" she cried, "I always liked
you better than any one else, Snowy. I never
thought I was going to see you again."</p>

<p>"My dear, dear little Viola!" cried Gertrude.
"Have you dropped from the clouds?
Why, this is too good to be true. But you are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
wet through! Come in this moment with me,
and get on dry things!"</p>

<p>She hurried Viola away to the tents, and
Mr. Merryweather took possession of her
brother with the same hospitable intent,
though Tom Vincent protested that he was
"no wetter than was entirely comfortable."</p>

<p>Phil, taking in his sail, turned an expressive
eye on his twin, who had come aboard
to help him.</p>

<p>"Gee!" he said, thoughtfully. "A new
variety, Obadiah! Pollybirdia singularis, as
Edward Lear hath it."</p>

<p>"She's mighty pretty!" said Gerald.</p>

<p>"She is that!" said Phil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>ABOUT VISITING</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Good-by</span>, Tommy, dear. Be sure to tell
Mamma that I thought she would not mind
my staying, when Mrs. Merryweather was so
perfectly heavenly as to ask me. Be sure to
tell her that my skirt is <i>all</i> cockled up, so that
you could put it in your waistcoat pocket,
Tom; and that the <i>only</i> way to save it is to
press it <i>damp</i>, and let it <i>dry</i> before I put it
on. Tell her that I have got on a dress of
the Snowy's that is simply <i>divine</i>,&mdash;more becoming
than anything I ever had on; and
that my silk waist has run&mdash;oh, tell her it
has run <i>miles</i>, Tom, so that I can never&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there, Vi!" cried Tom Vincent,
pushing his boat off. "<i>I</i> must run, before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
you swamp me entirely with messages. I'll
come back for you to-morrow, and bring your
toggery. Ever so many thanks, everybody.
You've been awfully good. I've had a corking
time. Good-by!"</p>

<p>The sail filled, the boat swung round, and
was soon speeding along the lake, while her
owner still waved his cap and looked back to
the wharf, where the campers stood, giving
back his greeting with hearty good will.</p>

<p>"Nice chap!" said Gerald to Phil.</p>

<p>"Corker!" said Phil to Gerald.</p>

<p>"Nor," added Gerald, turning to look after
the girls as they walked back along the slip,
"nor is the sororial adjunct totally devoid
of attraction. What thinkest, Fergy?"</p>

<p>He shot a quick glance at his brother, and
seemed to await his reply with some eagerness.</p>

<p>"I think she's as pretty as a picture," said
Phil, soberly.</p>

<p>"You have a nose on your face, if it comes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to that," said Gerald. "At least it passes for
one. <i>Weiter!</i>"</p>

<p>"I think she's awfully jolly, and all that,"
said Phil. "Nice, jolly, good-natured girl."</p>

<p>"Granted; she's great fun."</p>

<p>"But," Phil went on, slowly,&mdash;"oh, well!
you know what I mean. If our girls went
on like that, we should be under the painful
necessity of ducking them. Now, Peggy&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused and examined the mooring of
the boat, critically.</p>

<p>"Now, Peggy," Gerald repeated, jogging
him with his elbow. "Always finish a sentence
when you can, son. It argues poverty
of invention to have to stop in the middle.
You can always fall back on 'tooral looral
lido,' if you can't think of anything else.
What about Peggy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. Only she is just like the
rest of us, and that seems more natural; that's
all."</p>

<p>"And 'beyond a doubt we are the people;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and wisdom will perish with us,'" quoted
Gerald, his face brightening as he spoke.
"'Tis well. Come on, thou antiquated ape,
and let us pump out the float."</p>

<p>Meantime the girls had sought their favorite
pine parlor, and were deep in talk. <i>High</i>
would be a more descriptive adjective; for
Viola Vincent was the principal talker, and
her shrill, clear treble quivered up to the very
tree-tops, startling the birds in their nests,
and sending the squirrels scampering to and
fro with excitement.</p>

<p>"My dear, this is too delicious, simply <i>too!</i>
I should expire, if I lived here, of pure joy.
Oh, Snowy, what a darling you are! Your
nose is just as straight as ever, isn't it?
Rulers, my dear, are crooked beside it, aren't
they? If I had a straight nose, I should pass
away from sheer bliss. My nose turns up
more every year; it's the only aspiring thing
about me. Pothooks are straight by comparison.
Isn't it a calamity?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tiptilted like the petal of a flower," said
Gertrude, laughing. "I always thought your
nose one of your prettinesses, Vanity, and I
believe you think so, too."</p>

<p>"Oh! my <i>dear</i>, how <i>can</i> you?" cried Viola,
caressing her little nose, which was certainly
piquant and pretty enough to please any one.
"You don't really mean it, do you? You
just say it to comfort me, don't you? You
<i>are</i> such a comforting darling! Where did
you get that heavenly shade of green, Snowy?
I never saw anything so lovely in my life. It
is just the color of jade. My dear, I saw
some jade bracelets the other day that were
simply <i>made</i> for you. I wanted to tear them
from the girl's arms, and say, 'What are you
doing with the Snowy's bracelets?' She was
a dump, with a complexion like Doctor Somebody
or other's liniment. A person who can
wear jade is simply the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, come, Vanity!" said Peggy, good-naturedly.
"Come out of the millinery business,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and tell us about yourself, and about the
other girls. What has become of Vex&mdash;of
Vivia Varnham?"</p>

<p>"My dear! haven't you heard?"</p>

<p>"Not a word! You have never written, you
know, since we left school, and she would not
be likely to."</p>

<p>"You didn't love each other quite to distraction,
did you?" said Viola. "Poor V. V.!
she really was the limit sometimes, wasn't
she? I never minded her, of course, because I
never listened to what she said. Besides, she
was like pickles, you know; you just took her
with the rest of your dinner, and she didn't
make much difference. I used to tell her so.
Well, poor V. V.! You never could guess:
married, my dear!"</p>

<p>"Married!" echoed Peggy and Gertrude.</p>

<p>"Married! to a missionary; widower, with
four children. Gone to China! You need not
believe it unless you like; I don't believe it
myself, though I saw them married."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is hard to believe, Vi!" said Gertrude.
"How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"My dear, <i>the</i> limit! positively, the boundary
line, arctic circle, and that sort of thing.
Love at first sight, on both sides. Spectacles,
bald,&mdash;not the spectacles, but he,&mdash;snuffy
to a degree! You really never <i>did!</i> I was the
first person she told. I simply screamed.
'My dear!' I said, 'you <i>cannot</i> mean it. You
could <i>not</i> live with that waistcoat!'</p>

<p>"She told me I was frivolous&mdash;which I
never attempted to deny&mdash;and said I did not
understand, which was the truth. She looked
really quite sweet in her wedding-dress, and
when she went away she was quite softened,
she truly was, and wept a little weep, and so
did I. You see, Snowy, the very first thing I
can remember in my life is V. V.'s breaking
my doll over my head. I miss her dreadfully,
I do indeed; nobody has been&mdash;well, acidulated,
to me since she went, and I need the
tonic. And speaking of tonics, where is Beef?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
where is the Fluffy? You know"&mdash;turning
to Margaret&mdash;"I used to call the Snowy
and the Fluffy and the Horny my triple tonic,
Beef, Wine, and Iron; and the Fluffy was
Beef. Steady and square, you know, and red
and brown; exactly like beef; simply <i>no</i> difference
except the clothes. How is she,
Snowy?"</p>

<p>"The Fluffy&mdash;Bertha Haughton, you know,
Margaret&mdash;is teaching in Blankton High
School; very busy, very happy, indeed, perfectly
absorbed in her work. I have a letter
from her in my pocket this minute, that came
last night. Would you like to hear it?"</p>

<p>And amid a clamor of eager assent, she
drew out the letter and read as follows.</p>

<p>"'Dear Snowy: It is good to hear about
all the jolly times at Camp. I wish I could
come, but see no way to it just now. Yes, I
know school is over, but there are the rank
lists to make out, and all kinds of odd end-of-the-year
chores to be done; besides, two of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
boys have conditions to work out,&mdash;going to
college in the fall,&mdash;and I am tutoring them.
They are two of the dearest boys that ever were,
only not very bright, and I have promised to
stand by them.' This is the way she behaves,
after teaching all the year; she is incorrigible!
'All the others passed without conditions,
and three of them got honors, so I am very
proud and happy. This has been the best
year of all; but then, I say that every year,
don't I? I do feel more and more that I am
doing the thing in the whole world that I like
best to do.'</p>

<p>"The rest is just messages, and so on; but
you see how happy she is, and how utterly
absorbed."</p>

<p>"My dear, it is <i>too</i> amazing!" cried Viola
Vincent. "The very thought of teaching
makes me simply dissolve with terror; little
drops of water, my dear, would be all that
would be left of poor Vanity; not a grain of
sand to hold her together. Hush! let me tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
you something! Last year I tried to teach a
class in Sunday school,&mdash;great, terrible boys,
taller than I was,&mdash;and I <i>almost</i> expired, I
assure you I did. They never knew their
lessons, and two of them made eyes at me,
and the rest made faces at each other; it was
simply excruciating. Then the rector asked
me if I didn't think I could dress more simply;
said I set an example, and so on. I told him
I was dressed like a broomstick then, as far as
simplicity was concerned, and so I was, simply
and positively like a broomstick; only my
dress&mdash;it was a rose-colored foulard, <i>the</i> most
angelic shade you ever saw, girls; just like a
sunset cloud, somebody said&mdash;happened to
have ruffles to the waist, and ribbons fluttering
about more or less. He <i>said</i> I fluttered,
and I told him I certainly did. 'I always
flutter, Mr. Monk,' I said. 'When I don't
flutter, I shall be dead.' Which was true.
He was quite peevish, but I was firm; you
know you <i>have</i> to be firm about such things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Only, the next Sunday he happened to come
by when one of those great dreadful boys
asked me if Solomon's seal was tame, and I
said I didn't think it was. Well, I <i>didn't!</i>
But he wrote me a note next day, saying he
thought teaching was not my <i>forte</i>, and perhaps
I would like visiting better. I fully
agreed with him, so now I visit, and it is
simply dandy. I just love it!"</p>

<p>"Tell us about your visiting, Vi!" said
Gertrude. "I am going to take it up next
winter, and I should like to know how you
do it."</p>

<p>"My dear! Such sport! There are some
dear old ladies I go to see, perfect old ducks;
in a Home, you know. I go once a week,
and I put on <i>all</i> my frills, and never wear the
same dress twice if I can help it, and I tell
them all about the parties I go to, and what
I wear, and what my partners are like, and
about the suppers, and take them my German
favors, and they simply <i>love</i> it! Mr. Monk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
thinks it's terrible that I don't read them
tracts; my dear, they abominate tracts, and
so do I; we found that out at once. So I
read them the gayest, frilliest little stories
I can find, that are really <i>nice</i>, and they
<i>adore</i> it. One day&mdash;my <i>dears!</i> will you
promise never to breathe it if I tell you something?
never even to <i>sneeze</i> it?"</p>

<p>"We promise! We promise!" cried all
the girls.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;hush! It was simply fierce; and
<i>the</i> greatest sport I ever had in my life.
There is one old lady in the Home who is too
perfectly sweet for anything. Miss Bathsheba
Barry; did you ever hear such a delicious
name? She is just my height, and as
pretty as a picture in her cap and kerchief.
They all wear caps and kerchiefs, and little
gray gowns, the most becoming costume you
ever saw; I am going into the Home the very
minute my looks begin to go, because I <i>do</i> look
quite&mdash;but wait! Hush! not a word! Well!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
I had been teasing Miss Barry for ever and
ever so long to let me dress up in her things,
because I knew they would suit me, and at
last, one day, the dear old thing consented.
It was the time for the matron's afternoon
visit, and she is very jolly, and I wanted to
surprise her. So I put on the little gray gown,
and the delicious cap, just like Rembrandt's
mother, and the white net kerchief&mdash;don't
you adore white net, Snowy? it softens the
face so!&mdash;and the apron; and then I went
and sat down in Miss Barry's chair by the
window, with her knitting, and put on her
spectacles&mdash;oh! how she did laugh. Then
we heard steps, and Miss Barry went
into the closet and shut the door all but
a crack to peep through, and I turned
my head away from the door, and knitted
away for dear life. Oh, girls! The door
opened, and I heard Mrs. Poddle say, 'This
way, gentlemen! This is Miss Barry's room.'
<i>Gentlemen!</i> My dears, I thought I should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
pass away! Then there came great, loud
men's steps, and I heard Mr. Monk's voice&mdash;'This
is one of our most interesting inmates,
Bishop! Eighty-seven years old, and as
sprightly as a girl. A most pious and
exemplary person. Good morning, Miss
Barry! How is your rheumatism to-day?'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/gs07.jpg" width="500" height="371" alt="&quot;&#39;SIMPLY FIERCE, YOUR REVERENCE!&#39; SAID I.&quot;" title="&quot;&#39;SIMPLY FIERCE, YOUR REVERENCE!&#39; SAID I.&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;SIMPLY FIERCE, YOUR REVERENCE!&#39; SAID I.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"'Simply fierce, your reverence!' said I, in
a little squeaky voice, as like Miss Barry's as
I could make it. I kept my face turned
away, and pretended to be counting stitches
very hard.</p>

<p>"'Ahem!' said Mr. Monk. I could hear
that he was surprised, for, of course, Miss
Barry wouldn't say 'simply fierce,' but it
slipped out before I knew it.</p>

<p>"'Miss Barry,' he said, 'I have brought
Bishop Ballantyne to see you. I am sure you
will be glad to receive him.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, I should perfectly <i>love</i> to see the
Bishop!' I said; because Bishop Ballantyne
is simply a duck, an adorable duck; but still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
I did not turn round; and I could hear Miss
Barry squeaking with laughter in the closet,
and it was really getting quite awful. But
now Mr. Monk began to suspect something.
I believe he thought I had been drinking, or
rather that Miss Barry had, poor old dear.
He said, in a pretty awful voice: 'What
does this mean? Miss Barry, I desire that, if
you are unable to rise, you will at least turn
round, and receive Bishop Ballantyne in a
fitting manner. I cannot conceive&mdash;I must
beg you to believe, Bishop, that this has never
happened before. I am beyond measure distressed.
Miss Barry,&mdash;'</p>

<p>"And then he stopped, for I turned round.
I had to, of course; there was nothing else
to do.</p>

<p>"'How do you do, Bishop Ballantyne?'
I said. 'Can you tell me whether Solomon's
seal was tame or not?'</p>

<p>"For a minute they both stared as if they
had seen a ghost; but then the Bishop went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
off into a great roar of laughter, and I
thought he would laugh himself into fits, and
me, too; and the more solemn Mr. Monk
looked, the more we laughed; and Miss Barry
was cackling like a hen in the closet&mdash;oh, it
was great, girls, it truly was! At last Mr.
Monk had to laugh too, he couldn't help it;
it was simply too utter, you know. He said
I was enough to break up an entire parish;
and the Bishop said he would take me into
his, cap and all. And then the matron came
back, and Miss Barry came out, and we all
stayed to tea, the Bishop and Mr. Monk and
I, and had the time of our lives; at least, I
did.</p>

<p>"So you see, girls, visiting <i>can</i> be the greatest
sport in the world, if you only know how to
do it. But we all had to promise Mr. Monk
and Mrs. Poddle not to tell, because they said
it was enough to break up the discipline of the
Home, and I suppose it was."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>MOONLIGHT AGAIN</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> evening was showery, and indoor
games were the order of it. The first half-hour
after the dishes were washed (a task
performed to music, all hands joining in the
choruses of "John Peel," "Blow, ye winds of
morning," etc.) was spent quietly enough,
four of the party at parcheesi, the others busy
over crokinole and jackstraws; but by and by
there was a cry of "Boston!" and instantly
boards and counters were put away on their
shelf, and the decks cleared for action. The
whole party drew their chairs into a circle,
and the fun began. A pleasant sight it was
to see Mr. Merryweather blindfold in the middle
of the circle, calling out the numbers two
by two, and trying to catch the flitting figures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
as they changed places. A pleasant sight it
was to see the young people leaping, crouching,
and gliding across the circle, avoiding his
outstretched arms with surprising agility.</p>

<p>"Two and Fourteen!" he would cry; and
Gerald and Bell would slip from their places,
like shadows. Gerald was across in two long,
noiseless lopes, while Bell whisked under her
father's very hand, which almost closed on
her flying skirt; and a shout of "All over!"
greeted the accomplishment of the exchange.</p>

<p>"This will never do!" said Mr. Merryweather.
"You all have quicksilver in your
heels, I believe. Seven and Twelve! Come
Seven, come Twelve!"</p>

<p>Seven and Twelve were Jack Ferrers and
Peggy, and they came. Jack, gathering his
long legs under him, crept on all fours half-way
round the circle, and then made a plunge
for the chair which Peggy had just vacated.
He landed on the edge, and over went chair
and Jack into the fireplace with a resounding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
crash. This startled Peggy so that she ran
directly into Mr. Merryweather's arms, and
was caught and firmly held.</p>

<p>"Let me see!" said Mr. Merryweather.
"One pigtail! But I believe all you wretched
girls dress your hair precisely alike for 'Boston.'
Ha! peculiar sleeve-buttons! Now
who has buttons like these? Peggy!"</p>

<p>Then it was Peggy's turn to be blindfolded,
and a vigorous "<i>Colin Maillard</i>" she made,
flying hither and thither, and coming within
an ace of catching Gerald himself, who was
rarely caught. Finally she seized a flying
pigtail belonging to Kitty; and so the merry
game went on till all were out of breath with
running and laughing.</p>

<p>Phil went to the door to breathe the cool
air, and came back with the announcement,
"All clear overhead, perfectly corking moonlight.
Why do we stay indoors?"</p>

<p>"Canoes!" cried the younger Merryweathers;
and there was a rush for the door;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
but the Chief stopped them with a gesture.
"Too late!" he said. "It is nine o'clock
now; time you were in bed, Kitty."</p>

<p>"We might sit on the float and sing a
little," suggested Mrs. Merryweather.</p>

<p>"The float! The float!" shouted the boys
and girls. There was a snatching up of pillows
and wraps, and the whole family
trooped down to the float, where they established
themselves in a variety of picturesque
attitudes. Again it was a wonderful night;
the late moon was just rising above the dark
trees, no longer the full round, but still brilliant
enough to fill the world with light.</p>

<p>"This has been a wonderful moon!" said
some one.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gerald; "it is quite the last
thing in moons, not the ordinary article at
all. We don't have ordinary moons on this
pond. Who made that highly intellectual
remark?"</p>

<p>"It was I," said Bell, laughing; "and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
maintain, Jerry, that this moon <i>has</i> been a
very long, and a very&mdash;well, a very splendid
one. Just think! not a single cloudy evening
till this one; and now it clears off in time
to give us our moonlight hour before bed-time."</p>

<p>"The harvest moon is always long," said
Mr. Merryweather. "Bell is perfectly right,
Jerry."</p>

<p>"Strike home!" said Gerald, baring his
breast with a dramatic gesture. "Strike
home!</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'There's no more moonlight for poor Uncle J.,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he's gone whar de snubbed niggers go.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I was just going to propose singing," said
his mother; "but before we begin, suppose
we do honor to this good moon, that has
treated us so well. Let every one give a
quotation in her honor. I will begin:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'That orb&egrave;d maiden with white fire laden,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whom mortals call the moon,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">By the midnight breezes strewn.'</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Shelley. I am a cloud, be it understood!"</div>

<p>"I should hardly have guessed it," said Mr.
Merryweather. "My turn? I'll go back to
Milton:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"'Now glowed the firmament</span><br />
With living sapphires; Hesperus, that led<br />
The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon,<br />
Rising in clouded majesty, at length<br />
Apparent queen, unveiled her peerless light,<br />
And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.'"<br />
</div>

<p>"Oh, I say!" murmured Gerald; "that is
a peach!"</p>

<p>"Jerry," said his mother, plaintively, "have
you <i>no</i> adjectives, my poor destitute child? I
can imagine few things less peach-like than
that glorious passage. But never mind! Jack,
it is your turn."</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'The gray sea and the long black land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the yellow half-moon large and low&mdash;'"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>said Jack, half under his breath.</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>"It isn't yellow, and it isn't half," said
Gerald. "But never mind, as the Mater says.
Margaret, you come next."</p>

<p>Margaret looked up, her face full of tranquil
happiness.</p>

<p>"I was thinking," she said, "of some lines
from 'Evangeline,' that I have always loved.
I say them over to myself every night in this
wonderful moon-time:</p>

<div class='poem2'>
"'Beautiful was the night. Behind the black wall of the forest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Tipping its summit with silver, arose the moon. On the river</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Peggy, what have you for us?" asked
Mrs. Merryweather.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried poor Peggy, "you know I
never can remember poetry, Mrs. Merryweather.
I shall have to take to 'Mother
Goose.' I know I am terribly prosy&mdash;well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
prosaic, then, Margaret; what's the difference?
But I can't think of anything except:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'The Man in the Moon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came down too soon,'&mdash;</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and that doesn't go with all these lovely
things you have all been saying."</div>

<p>"It gives me mine, though!" said Phil.
And he sang, merrily:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'The Man in the Moon was looking down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With winking and with blinking frown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And stars beamed out bright</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To look on the night;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Man in the Moon was looking!'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Phil!" cried Gertrude. "How can you?
Comic opera is an insult to a moon like this."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said her brother. "Sorry
I spoke. Next time I'll sing it to some other
moon,&mdash;one of Jupiter's; or the brick one in
Doctor Hale's story. Go on, Toots, since
you are so superior. It's your turn."</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That tips with silver all the fruit-tree tops,'"</span><br />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>said Gertrude. "I can't remember the next
line."</div>

<p>"What I miss in this game," said Gerald,
in a critical tone, "is accuracy. There isn't
a fruit-tree on the Point."</p>

<p>"And the moon, of course, limits herself
strictly to the point!" said Gertrude, laughing.</p>

<p>"It's more than you do!" retorted her
brother. "But a truce to badinage! I go
back to prose and 'Happy Thoughts.' 'I say
"O moon!" rapturously, but nothing comes
of it.'"</p>

<p>"But something shall come of it this time,
Jerry," said his mother. "Perhaps we have
had enough quotations now. Give us the
'Gipsy Song.'"</p>

<p>Nothing loth, Gerald sang the wild, beautiful
song, his sisters humming the accompaniment.
Then one song and another was
called for, and the night rang with ballad
and barcarole, glee and round. There never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
seemed to be any limit to the Merryweather
repertoire.</p>

<p>Presently Bell whispered to Gertrude; the
latter passed the whisper on to Margaret and
Peggy. Silently all four girls rose and slipped
away, with a word breathed into Mrs. Merryweather's
ear, begging her to keep up the
singing.</p>

<p>"Where are the girls going?" asked their
father.</p>

<p>"They will be back in a moment," said
Mrs. Merryweather. "Give us 'Prinz Eugen,'
boys; all of you together!"</p>

<p>And out rolled, in booming bass and silvery
tenor, the glorious old camp song of the German
wars:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Prinz Eugen, der edle Ritter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Woll't dem Kaiser wied'rum kriegen</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stadt und Festung Belgerad."</span><br />
</div>

<p>This was a favorite song of the Merryweather
boys, and they never knew which
verse to leave out, so they generally sang all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
nine of them. They did so this time, and
finally ended with a prolonged roar of:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Liess ihm bringen recht zu Peterwardein."<br />
</div>

<p>A moment of silence followed. Indeed,
none of the singers had any breath left.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'And silence like a poultice falls,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To heal the blows of sound!'"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>quoted Mr. Merryweather. "Hark! what is
that?"</div>

<p>Again the sound of singing was heard.
This time it came from the direction of the
tents. Girl's voices, thrilling clear and sweet
on the stillness. The air was even more familiar
than that of "Prinz Eugen," one of
the sweetest airs that ever echoed to moonlight
and the night:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Dass ich so traurig bin;"&mdash;</span><br />
</div>

<p>The girls came singing out into the moonlight,
hand in hand. They were in bathing-dress;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
their long hair floated over their
shoulders; their white arms shone in the white
light. Instead of coming back to the float,
they plunged into the water, and swam, still
singing, to a rock that reared a great rounded
back from the water. Up on this rock they
climbed, and sat them down, shaking off the
water in diamond spray; and still their voices
rang out, clear and thrilling on the quiet
air:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Die sch&ouml;nste Jungfrau sitzet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Dort oben wunderbar;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Ihr goldnes Geschmeide blitzet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sie k&auml;mmt ihr goldenes Haar."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Gee!" muttered Gerald to himself.</p>

<p>"Pretty!" said Mr. Merryweather, taking
his pipe from between his teeth. "Miranda,
I don't know that I ever saw anything much
prettier than that."</p>

<p>His wife made no reply, but her eyes spoke
for her. None of the lads could look more
eagerly or more joyfully at that lovely picture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Were not two of the maidens her very
own?</p>

<p>Gertrude was facing them as she sang. Her
red-gold hair fell like a mantle of glory about
her, far below her waist; her arms, clasped
behind her head, were like carved ivory; her
face was lifted, and the moon shone full on
its pure outlines and candid brow. Bell's rosy
face was partly in shadow, but her noble voice
floated out rich and strong, filling the air with
melody. There was no possibility of doubt, to
Mrs. Merryweather's mind, which two of
the quartette were most attractive. Yet
when she said softly to the son who happened
to be next her: "Aren't they lovely, Jerry?"
he answered, abstractedly, "Isn't she!" and
his eyes were fixed, not on stately Gertrude,
or stalwart Bell, but on a slender figure between
them, that clung timidly to the rock,
one hand clasped in Peggy's. Also, it is to
be noted that, when the song was over, and
Peggy made an exceptionally clean and graceful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
dive off the rock, Phil exclaimed, "Jove!
that was a corker!" to which John Ferrers
replied, "Yes; the sweetest contralto I ever
heard."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"I never heard you sing better than you did
last night," said Jack to Bell. It was next
morning, and he was stirring the porridge industriously,
while she mixed the johnny-cake.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;HE WAS STIRRING THE PORRIDGE INDUSTRIOUSLY, WHILE SHE MIXED THE JOHNNY-CAKE.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"So glad!" said Bell, simply. "I aim to
please. I'd put in a little more water, Jack,
if I were you; it's getting too stiff."</p>

<p>Jack poured in the water, and stirred for
some minutes in silence. Presently he said:
"I heard from those people last night."</p>

<p>"From the Conservatory? Oh, Jack! do
tell me! I have been thinking so much
about it. Is it all right?"</p>

<p>"I think so," said Jack, slowly. "They
offer me two thousand, and there is an excellent
chance for private pupils besides; I
have decided to accept it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, how splendid! Oh, I am so
glad! I knew it would come&mdash;the chance&mdash;if
you only had patience, and you surely
have had it. How happy Hilda will be!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jack, soberly. "I owe it to
Hilda, every bit of it, as I owe several other
things. This, for example."</p>

<p>"This?" repeated Bell. "Meaning the
porridge?"</p>

<p>She spoke lightly, yet there was an undertone
of feeling in her voice.</p>

<p>"The porridge, and all the rest of it," said
Jack. "The place, the life, the friends, the
happiness, and&mdash;you&mdash;all!"</p>

<p>It might have been noted that the "all"
was added after a moment's pause, as if it
were an afterthought.</p>

<p>"Dear Hilda!" said Bell, softly. "We all
owe her a very great deal."</p>

<p>"If it had not been for Hildegarde
Grahame," said Jack, "I should have grown
up a savage."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! no, you would not, Jack."</p>

<p>"Yes, I should, Bell. When I first came
to Roseholme, I was just at the critical time.
I adored my father, who was an angel,&mdash;too
much of one to understand a mere human
boy. I came to please him, and at first I
didn't get hold of Uncle Tom at all, nor he
of me. He thought me an ass,&mdash;well, he
was right enough there,&mdash;and I thought him
a bear and a brute. I was on the point of
running away and starting out on my own
account, my fiddle and I against the world,
when I met Hilda, and she changed life from
an enemy into a friend."</p>

<p>Bell was silent for a moment; then, "I
have often wondered&mdash;" she said, and broke
off short.</p>

<p>"So have I!" said Jack. "I don't know
now why I didn't. Yes, I do, too."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Bell, her eyes on her
mixing-bowl.</p>

<p>"It's hard to put it into words," said Jack,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
with a queer little laugh. "I suppose I felt
that I never should have had a chance; but&mdash;but
yet, I am not sure that I should not
have tried my luck, even then, if&mdash;if something
else had not happened to me."</p>

<p>Bell asked no more questions: the johnny-cake
seemed to be at a critical point; she
stirred assiduously, and Jack, turning to look
at her, could see only the tip of a very rosy
little ear under the brown, clustering hair.</p>

<p>There was another silence, broken only by
the singing of the teakettle and the soft,
thick "hub-bubble" of the boiling porridge.</p>

<p>"Bell!" said Jack, presently.</p>

<p>"Yes, Jack."</p>

<p>"I had another letter last night, that I
haven't told you about yet."</p>

<p>"From Hilda?"</p>

<p>"No. From the manager of the Arion
Quartette. They want me to go on a tour
with them in the autumn, before the Conservatory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
opens. It's a great chance, and
they offer me twice what I am worth."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack!" cried Bell, turning her face,
shining with pleasure, full on him. "How
glorious! how perfectly glorious! Oh! this
is great news indeed."</p>

<p>"There is only one difficulty," said Jack.
"I have to provide my own accompanist."</p>

<p>"But you can easily do that!" said Bell.</p>

<p>"Can I?" cried Jack Ferrers, dropping
the porridge spoon and coming forward, his
two hands held out, his brown face in a glow.
"Can I, Bell? There is only one accompanist
in the world for me, and I want her
for life. Can I have her, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack!" cried Bell, and another spoon
was dropped.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Children, you are letting that porridge
burn!" cried Mrs. Merryweather, as she
hurried into the kitchen a few minutes
later.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Mammy, I am so sorry!" said Bell,
looking up,</p>

<div class='poem'>
"All kind o' smily round the lips,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And teary round the lashes."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Oh, Mammy, I am so glad!" cried Jack
Ferrers; and without more ado he kissed
Mrs. Merryweather. "I like burnt porridge!"
said this young gentleman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>CONCERNING VARIOUS THINGS</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Where</span> are you going, Margaret?" asked
Willy.</p>

<p>"Up to the farm. Bell lost one of her
knitting-needles, and thought she might have
dropped it there; she is up there now, hunting
for it, and here it was in my tent all the
time. Would you like to come with me,
Willy?"</p>

<p>Willy twinkled with pleasure, and fell into
step beside her, and the two walked along the
pleasant grassy road through the fields, talking
busily. They had become great friends,
and Willy was never tired of hearing about
Basil, who, he declared, "must certainly be
a corker."</p>

<p>"I suppose he is, Willy," said Margaret,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
with resignation. "There seems nothing else
for any nice person to be. Did I tell you
how brave he was when a great savage dog
attacked our poor puppies? Oh, you must
hear that."</p>

<p>The recital of Basil's heroism lasted till
they reached the farmhouse, both in a state
of high enthusiasm, and Willy filled with
ardent longings for attacks by savage dogs,
that he might show qualities equal to those
of the youthful hero. (N. B. Basil, honest,
freckled, and practical, would have been much
surprised to hear himself held up as a youthful
embodiment of Bayard and the Cid in one.)</p>

<p>"I'll wait for you out here, Margaret," he
said, when they came to the door. "No,
I don't want to come in; they will tell me
how I've grown, and I do get so tired of it.
I'll sit on the fence and think; I like to
think."</p>

<p>Margaret nodded sympathetically and went
in. The door opened directly into a wide,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
sunny kitchen, as bright as sunshine and
cleanliness could make it. An elderly woman
was standing before a great wheel, spinning
wool; beside her, Bell, Gertrude, and Peggy
stood watching with absorbed attention. All
looked up at Margaret's entrance, and the
woman, who had a kind, strong face and
sweet brown eyes, laid down her shuttle with
a smile of welcome.</p>

<p>"I want to know if this is you," she said.
"You're quite a stranger, ain't you? I kind
o' looked for you when the gals come in."</p>

<p>"I meant to come, Mrs. Meadows, I truly
did; but I was tidying up the tent, and I am
so slow about it."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Meadows," said Peggy, laughing,
"she wipes every nail-head three times a day,
and goes over the whole with a microscope
when she has finished, to see if she can find
a speck of dust."</p>

<p>"Doos she so?" inquired Mrs. Meadows.
"I don't hardly dare to ask her to set down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
in this room, then. What with the wool
flyin' and all, it's a sight, most times."</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Meadows!" exclaimed Gertrude.
"When you know you are almost as
particular as she is! But, Margaret, do you
see what we are doing? We are having a
spinning lesson. It is <i>so</i> exciting! Come
and watch."</p>

<p>"I came to bring your knitting-needle,"
said Margaret. "Look! it was in my tent,
just the end of it sticking out of a crack in
the floor. If I had not tidied up, in the way
you reprobate, Bell, you might never have
got it again."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, somebody would have stepped
on it," laughed Bell. "But I confess I am
very grateful for this special attack of tidying.
Now, Mrs. Meadows, I shall be all
ready for that new yarn as soon as you have
it spun."</p>

<p>"My land! don't you want I should color
it? I was callatin' to color all this lot."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I like this gray mixture so much;
it is just the color for the boys' stockings.
By the way, have you seen the boys, Mrs.
Meadows? I was looking for them everywhere
before I came up."</p>

<p>"Let me see, where did I see them boys?"
Mrs. Meadows pondered, drawing the yarn
slowly through her fingers. "Gerild and
Phillup, you mean? They passed through
the yard right after dinner, I should say it
was, on their velocipedies; going at a great
rate, they was. Here's Jacob, mebbe he'll
know."</p>

<p>Jacob, massive and comely, in his customary
blue overalls, entered, beaming shyly.
"Good mornin', ladies!" he said. "Mother
treatin' you well?"</p>

<p>"Very well, Jacob!" said Bell. "We are
having a spinning lesson, and find it very
interesting."</p>

<p>"I want to know. Well, I allers got on
without that branch of edication myself,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
said Jacob. He was standing near the door,
and the girls noticed that he kept his hands
behind him.</p>

<p>"Mother, ain't you give the girls no
apples?" he said.</p>

<p>"There!" cried Mrs. Meadows, apologetically.
"I never thought on't."</p>

<p>"Now, ain't that a sight!" said Jacob, reprovingly.
"I thought I could trust you not
to let 'em starve, mother, but yet someways
I felt I ought to bring the apples myself. I
dono's they're fit to eat, though."</p>

<p>Still beaming shy benevolence, he brought
from behind him a basket of beautiful rosy
apples, every one of which had evidently been
polished with care&mdash;and the sleeve of his
coat.</p>

<p>"Oh, what perfect beauties!" cried the
girls. "Oh, thank you, Jacob!"</p>

<p>"What kind are they?" asked Peggy.
"They <i>are</i> good!" Peggy never lost a moment
in sampling an apple, and her teeth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
now met in the firm, crisp flesh with every
sign of approval.</p>

<p>"Benoni! about the best fall apple there
is, round these parts; that is, for any one as
likes 'em crips. Some prefer a sweet apple,
but I like a fruit that's got some sperit in it,
same as I do folks. Well, I wish you all
good appetite; I must be goin' back to my
hoein' lesson, I guess."</p>

<p>"Oh! Jacob, have you seen Jerry and Phil,
lately?" asked Gertrude.</p>

<p>"No, I ain't. Yes I hev, too. They went
rocketin' past me this noon, and give me
some sarse as they went, and I give it 'em
back. I ain't seen 'em sence. They're up to
mischief, wherever they be, you can count on
that."</p>

<p>Jacob diffused his smile again, and withdrew.
The girls, still eating their apples,
turned eagerly to Mrs. Meadows. "Now, Mrs.
Meadows," they said, "we must go on
with our lesson. Margaret, sit down and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
learn with us; you know you want to
learn."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do!" said Margaret. "But I
don't think I'd better now, girls. Willy came
up with me, and he is waiting for me outside;
I promised to look at a nest he has found,
and I don't like to disappoint him. May
I come some other day, please, Mrs.
Meadows?"</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you may!" said Mrs.
Meadows. "Sorry to have ye go now, but
glad to see ye next time, and so you'll find it
nine days in the week, Miss Montfort. Good
day to ye, if ye must go."</p>

<p>Margaret shook the good woman's hand,
nodded gaily to the girls, and went out, to
find Willy sitting patiently on the fence.</p>

<p>"Was I a very long time, Willy?" she
asked. "I thought you might have got out
of patience and gone home."</p>

<p>"No!" said Willy, soberly. "You were a
good while, but then, girls always are. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
a fellow has sisters, you know, he gets used
to waiting."</p>

<p>"Oh! indeed!" said Margaret, much
amused.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Willy. "I don't think girls
have much idea of time, do you?"</p>

<p>"Why, Willy, I don't know that I have
ever considered the question. You see, I
have always been a girl myself, so perhaps
I am not qualified to judge. But&mdash;do you
think boys have so very much more idea?
It seems to me I know some one who has
been late for tea several times this week."</p>

<p>Willy looked conscious. "Well," he said,
"I know; but that is different. When you
are late for tea,&mdash;I mean when a boy is,&mdash;he
is generally doing something that he wants
very much indeed to get through with, fishing,
or splicing a bat, or something that
really has to be done. Besides, he knows
they won't wait tea for him, so it doesn't
make any difference."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see!" said Margaret. "And girls are
never doing anything important. Aren't you
rather severe on us, Willy?"</p>

<p>Willy was about to reassure her kindly, for
he was extremely fond of her; but at this
moment a cheery "Hallo!" was heard, and
the twins rode up on their bicycles, bright-eyed
and flushed after a fine spurt.</p>

<p>"Neck and neck!" said Gerald. "Margaret,
I hope you don't object to being a
winning-post. That was a great run."</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" asked Margaret,
as the two dismounted and walked along on
either side of her.</p>

<p>"Over to the Corners, to send a telegram
for the Pater. And thereby hangs a tale."</p>

<p>"May we hear it? We love a tale, don't
we, Willy?"</p>

<p>Willy did not look particularly enthusiastic,
but he murmured something, which Gerald
did not wait to hear.</p>

<p>"Well, the Pater desired to send a telegram,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
even winged words, to that man who has
been trying to send us shellac for the last
three weeks, and who has, we fear, broken
down from the strain. A neat despatch it
was: 'Send to-morrow, or not at all.&mdash;M.
Merryweather.' Well, we had just sent it,
when we heard some one behind us say, '<i>Oh</i>,
gosh!' in a tone of such despair that we
turned round to see if it was the shellac man
in person. It was little Bean, the pitcher of
the Corners team, all dressed up in his baseball
togs, scarlet breeches and blue shirt,
quite the bird of paradise, and reading a yellow
telegram, and his face black as thunder.
He was an impressionist study, wasn't he,
Fergy? We asked what was up, or rather
down, for elevation had no part in him. It
appeared that a match was on for this afternoon,
between the Baked Beans and the
Sweet Peas, the Corners and the Spruce Point
team. The Beans were all here except the
pitcher and first-baseman, brothers, who were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
to come over by themselves, as they lived at
some distance from the rest of the team; and
this telegram conveyed the cheering information,
that, instead of coming over, they had
come down with mumps, and were, in point
of fact, in their little beds."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a shame!" said Margaret.
"Poor lads! and mumps are such a distressing
thing."</p>

<p>"I rejoice to see that you also get your
singular and plural mixed in regard to
mumps," said Gerald. "You are human,
after all. But to tell the truth, I don't know
that sympathy with the mumpers was the
prevailing sentiment at the Corners."</p>

<p>"Gee! I should think not," said Phil.
"This was the match of the season, you see,
Margaret. The farmers had come from far
and near, and brought their wives and babies;
and the Corner fellows had got this gorgeous
uniform made, and bought out all the
red flannel in the county; and here were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
these two wretched chumps down with
mumps."</p>

<p>"Oh! but Phil," cried Margaret, "they
didn't do it on purpose, poor things; and
think how they were suffering! You are
heartless, I think."</p>

<p>"They would have suffered more if the
Baked Beans had got hold of them," said
Phil, with a grin; "or the other fellows
either, for that matter. But as it turned out,
it was the best thing that could have happened
for the Beans. He wasn't much of a
pitcher."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Willy, beginning
to be interested. "Did they get
another pitcher?"</p>

<p>"Did they? Well, I should remark! I let
on in a casual way that the former pitcher of
a certain college team was not more than a
hundred miles from the spot at that moment.
You should have seen that fellow's face, Margaret.
It really was a study. Perfect bewilderment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
for a minute, and then&mdash;well, I
believe he would have gone down on all fours
and carried Jerry to the field if he would not
have gone in any other way."</p>

<p>"Oh! please, Phil. I am bewildered, too.
Is Gerald a&mdash;a pitcher?"</p>

<p>"Is he? My child, he is the great original
North American jug."</p>

<p>"Oh, pooh!" said Gerald. "Don't be an
ass, Ferguson! You are as good a first-baseman
as I am pitcher, any day. Of course we
were glad to help them out, though I drew
the line at scarlet breeches. My mother's
angry shade hovered above me and forbade.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Go fight in fortune's deepest ditches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But oh, avoid the scarlet breeches!'</span><br />
</div>

<p>I could hear her say it. So I told him that
my hair and my temper were the only red I
ever wore, and he submitted, though sadly.
So we played; and it was a great game. And
we smote them hip and thigh, even to the
going down of the sun; or would have, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the day had been shorter. Phil made three
runs, Will."</p>

<p>"Jerry made three more Will," said Phil;
"and pitched like one o'clock, I tell you. I
never saw you play better, Obadiah. Those
last balls were perfect peaches. I wish you
had seen the game, Margaret."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Margaret. "I have never
seen a game of baseball."</p>

<p>"Oh! I say!" cried Phil and Willy. "What
a shame!"</p>

<p>"Where do you live?" asked Willy, in such
open wonder and commiseration that the
others all laughed.</p>

<p>"She lives in an enchanted castle, Willy,"
said Gerald; "with a magician who keeps
her in chains&mdash;of roses and pearls. He has
two attendant spirits who help to keep her in
durance that is not precisely vile. How is
Mrs. Cook, Margaret? Do you know, you
have hardly told me anything about Fernley
all this time? I want to know ever so many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
things. What became of the pretty lady whose
house was burned? Do you remember that?
I never shall forget it as long as I live."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I do!" said Margaret, blushing.
"She is still abroad, Gerald. I doubt if she
ever returns, or at least not for a long time.
She is well, and really happy, I think. Isn't
it wonderful?"</p>

<p>"You didn't see Miss Wolfe come down the
ladder!" said Gerald. "That was the most
wonderful thing I ever saw. Just as she
stepped out on the window-sill, the fire caught
the hem of her skirt. I thought she was gone
that time. I was just going to drop you and
run, when she stooped and squeezed the skirts
together&mdash;woollen skirts, fortunately&mdash;and
put it out; and then came swinging down
that rope to the ladder, and down the ladder
to the ground, as if she had been born in a
circus. I tell you, that was something to see.
Pity you missed it."</p>

<p>"Why did she miss it?" asked Willy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
"And what do you mean by dropping her,
Jerry?"</p>

<p>Gerald, whose eyes were shining with the
excitement of recollection, turned and looked
down at his small brother as if suddenly recalling
his existence.</p>

<p>"Margaret was&mdash;busy!" he said, briefly.
"And, I say, Father William, don't you want
to take my biky down and give him a feed
of oats? he is hungry. See him paw the
ground!" and he gave the bicycle a twirl.</p>

<p>"I must go," said Phil, remounting his
own. "Come along, Willy, and I'll race you
to Camp."</p>

<p>But for once Willy held back. "I was
going to take Margaret to see a redwing's
nest," he said. "I promised her I would."</p>

<p>"Oh! Margaret will excuse you," said Phil.
"Won't you, Margaret? Redwings' nests always
look better in the morning, besides.
Come on, boy, and I'll tell you all about the
game."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Willy still hesitated, looking at Margaret;
and she in her turn hesitated, blushing rosy
red. "Don't let me keep you, Willy dear,"
she said. "If you would like to hear about
the game&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Go on</i>, young un!" said Gerald, in a tone
of decision so unlike his usual bantering way,
that Willy stared, then yielded; and slowly
mounting the bicycle, started off with Phil
along the road.</p>

<p>They rode for some time in silence, Phil
being apparently lost in thought.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Willy at last, in an injured
tone.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, Belted Will?"</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to tell me about
the game," said Willy, moodily. "I say,
Phil! I think it was awfully rude of you and
Jerry to yank me off that way, when I had
promised Margaret to take her somewhere,
and we were going straight there when
you came along and broke in. I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
think that's any kind of way to do, and
I am sure Ma would say so, too. What
do you suppose Margaret thinks of me
now?"</p>

<p>"Ri tum ti tum ti tido!" carolled Phil.
"What do I suppose she thinks of you, Belted
One? Why, she thinks you are one of the
nicest boys she ever saw; and so you are,
when not in doleful dumps. See here, old
chap! you'll be older before you are younger,
and some day you will know a hawk from a
handsaw, <i>or</i> hernshaw, according to which
reading of 'Hamlet' you prefer. And now
as to this game!"</p>

<p>He plunged into a detailed account of the
great match, and soon Willy's eyes were sparkling,
and his cheeks glowing, and he had forgotten
all about Margaret and the redwing's
nest.</p>

<p>But as they crested the hill, which on the
other side dipped down to the camp, Phil
glanced back along the road. Margaret and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Gerald were walking slowly, deep in talk, and
did not see the wave of his hand. "Heigh,
ho!" said Phil; but he smiled even while he
sighed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>ON THE DOWN</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> afternoon, when most of the campers
were off fishing, Margaret wandered alone up
to the top of the great down behind the camp.
Thoroughly in love with the camp life as she
was, in most of its aspects, she could not learn
to care for fishing. To sit three, four, five
hours in a boat, on the chance of killing a
harmless and beautiful creature, did not, she
protested, appeal to her; and many a lively
argument had she had on the subject with
Bell and Gertrude, who were ardent fisher-maidens.</p>

<p>"But, Margaret, it is the sport!" Bell
would cry. "It isn't just killing, it is
sport!"</p>

<p>"But, Bell, if the sport does not amuse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
me!" Margaret would answer. "If I want
to kill something, I would rather kill spiders,
though I am trying not to be so afraid of
them&mdash;or mosquitoes."</p>

<p>Then the girls would cry out that she was
hopeless, and would gather up their reels and
rods and leave her to her own peaceful devices,
having even the generosity not to twit
her with inconsistency when she enjoyed her
delicately-fried perch at supper.</p>

<p>These solitary afternoons were sure to be
pleasant ones for Margaret. She loved the
merry companionship of the campers, but she
loved, too, to wander through the woods,
among the great straight-stemmed pines and
dark feathery hemlocks, or to track the little
clear brook through its windings, from the
great bog to its outlet into the lake; or, as
now, to stroll about over the great down, looking
down on the blue water below.</p>

<p>It was a perfect afternoon. Little white
clouds drifted here and there over the tops of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the wooded hills, but they only made the sky
more deeply and intensely blue. There was
just enough breeze to ripple the water so that
it caught every sunbeam, and set it dancing
on the tremulous surface. Below her a fish-hawk
poised and dipped, seeking his dinner;
far out, two black specks showed where her
friends were at their "sport." Margaret drew
a long breath of content.</p>

<p>"Oh, pleasant place!" she said. "How
glad I am that I am not in that boat. Oh,
pleasant place!"</p>

<p>She looked about her with happy eyes.
Before her, the earth fell away in an abrupt
descent to the lake, steep enough to be dignified
by the name of precipice; but behind
and on either hand it rolled away in billowy
slopes of green, crowned here and there with
patches of wood, and crossed by irregular lines
of stone wall.</p>

<p>"Oh, pleasant place!" said Margaret a
third time. "How many beautiful places I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
know! What a wonderful world of beauty it
is!"</p>

<p>Her mind went back to Fernley House, the
beloved home where she lived with her uncle
John Montfort: to the rose-garden, where
they loved to work together, the sunny lawns,
the shady alleys of box and laurel, the arbors
of honeysuckle and grape-vine. She could
almost see the beloved uncle, pruning-knife in
hand, bending over his roses; if only he did
not cut back the Ramblers too far! She could
almost see her little cousins, her children, as
she called them, Basil and Susan D., running
about with their butterfly-nets, shouting and
calling to each other. Did they think of her,
as she hourly thought of them? Did Uncle
John miss her? She must always miss him,
no matter how happy she might be with other
friends. A wave of homesickness ran through
her, and brought the quick tears to her eyes;
but she brushed them away with an indignant
little shake of her head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"Goose!" she said. "When will you learn
that it is a physical impossibility to be in two
places at once? You don't want to leave this
beautiful place and these dear people yet? Of
course, you don't! Well, then, don't behave
so! But all the same, it would be good to
hear Uncle John's voice!"</p>

<p>At this moment she heard,&mdash;not the beloved
voice for which she longed,&mdash;but certainly
a sound, breaking the stillness of the
afternoon; a sound made neither by wind nor
water. It did not sound like a bird, either;
nor&mdash;a beast?</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure!" thought Margaret. "It
may be a sheep. I saw the flock up there this
morning. Of course, it is a sheep."</p>

<p>The sound came again, louder this time, and
nearer; something between a snorting and a
blowing; it must be a very large sheep to
make such a loud noise.</p>

<p>Margaret turned to look behind her; but it
was not a sheep that she saw.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Just behind the rock on which she was sitting
the land rose in a high, green shoulder,
on the farther side of which it sloped gradually
down to a little valley. Over this shoulder
now appeared&mdash;a head! A head five times
as big as that of the biggest sheep that ever
bore fleece; a head crowned by long, sharp,
dangerous-looking horns. And now, as Margaret
sat transfixed with terror, another head
appeared, and another, and still another; till
a whole herd of cattle stood on the ridge
looking down at her.</p>

<p>Jet black, of colossal size, with gleaming
eyes and quivering nostrils, they were formidable
creatures to any eyes; but to poor
Margaret's they were monsters as terrible as
griffin or dragon. All cattle, even the mildest
old Brindle that ever stood to be milked, were
objects of dire alarm to her, but she had never
seen animals like these. Tales of the wild
cattle of Chillingham, of the fierce herds that
roam the Western prairies and the pampas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
of the South, rushed to her mind. She felt
fear stealing over her, a wild, unreasoning
panic which neither strength nor reason could
resist. She dared not move; she dared not
cry out for help; indeed, who was there to
hear if she did cry? She sat still on her rock,
her hands clasped together, her eyes, wide with
terror, fixed on the enemy.</p>

<p>The leader of the herd met her gaze with
one which to her excited fancy seemed threatening
and sinister. For a moment he stood
motionless; then, tossing his head with its
gleaming horns, and uttering another loud
snort, he took a step toward her; the rest followed.
Another step and another. Margaret
glanced wildly around her. On one side was
the precipice, on either hand a wide stretch of
open meadow; no hope of escape. She must
meet her death here, then, alone, with no human
eye to see, no human hand to help her in
her extremity. She crouched down on the
rock, and covered her eyes with her hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
The cattle drew nearer. Snuffing the air, tossing
their horns, with outstretched necks and
eager eyes, step by step they advanced. Now
they were close about her, their giant forms
blocking the sunlight, their gleaming eyes
fixed upon her. Margaret felt her senses deserting
her; but suddenly&mdash;hark! another
sound fell on her ear; a sound clear, resonant,
jubilant; the sound of a human voice,
singing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I'm an honest lad, though I be poor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And I niver was in love afore&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"<i>Gerald!</i>" cried Margaret. "Gerald,
help!" and she dropped quietly off the rock,
under the very feet of the black cattle.</p>

<p>When she came to herself, she was propped
against the rock, and Gerald was fanning her
with his cap and gazing at her with eyes of
anxiety and tenderness, which yet had a
twinkle in their depths.</p>

<p>"Better?" he asked, as he had asked once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
before under somewhat similar circumstances.
"Do say you are better, please! The house
isn't on fire this time, and neither is the
Thames."</p>

<p>Margaret struggled into a sitting posture.
"Oh! Gerald," she said, "I am so ashamed!
You will think I am always fainting, and,
indeed, I never have in all my life except
these two times. But they were so terrible&mdash;ah!
there they are still."</p>

<p>Indeed, the herd of cattle was standing
near, still gazing with gleaming eyes; but,
somehow, the look of ferocity was gone. She
could even see&mdash;with Gerald beside her&mdash;that
they were noble-looking creatures.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Gerald. "Don't call them
terrible; you will hurt their poor old feelings.
I know them of old, Horatio; fellows of
infinite jest."</p>

<p>"Are they&mdash;are they tame?" asked Margaret,
in amazement.</p>

<p>"Tame? I should say so. Look at this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
fellow! I have known him from a calf.
Did um want um's nosy rubbed?" he added,
addressing the huge leader, who was snuffing
nearer and nearer. "Come along, then, Popolorum
Tibby, and tell um's prettiest aunt
not to be afraid of um any more."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but they came all around me!"
said poor Margaret.</p>

<p>"Small blame to them! Showed their
good sense, not to say their taste. But to be
wholly candid, they came for salt."</p>

<p>"For salt? Those great monsters?"</p>

<p>"To be sure! Ellis, the farmer, makes
regular pets of them, and I always put a
lump of salt in my pocket when I am coming
their way. I never saw them in this pasture
before, though; the fence must be broken.
I believe I have some grains of salt left now.
See him take it like a lady!"</p>

<p>He held out his hand, with a little heap of
salt in it. The huge ox came forward, stepping
daintily, with neck outstretched and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
nostrils spread; put out a tongue like a pink
sickle, and neatly, with one comprehensive
lick, swept off every particle of salt, and
looked his appreciation.</p>

<p>Gerald patted the great muzzle affectionately.</p>

<p>"Good old Blunderbore!" he said. "I
almost carried you when you were a day old,
though you may not believe it. Come, Margaret,
give him a pat, and say you bear no
malice."</p>

<p>Margaret put out a timid hand and patted
the great black head. Blunderbore snuffed
and blew, and expressed his friendliness in
every way he could.</p>

<p>"Why, he is a dear, gentle creature!"
said the girl. "I shall never be afraid of
him again. And yet&mdash;oh, Gerald, I am so
glad you came!"</p>

<p>"So am I!" said Gerald.</p>

<p>"Because," Margaret went on, "of course,
I see how silly and foolish I was; but all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
same, I was terribly frightened, and I really
don't know what would have become of me if
you had not come, Gerald."</p>

<p>"But I did come, Margaret! I will always
come, whenever you want me, if it is
across the world."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;you must think me so <i>very</i> silly,
Gerald!"</p>

<p>"Do you wish to know what I think of
you?" asked Gerald.</p>

<p>Margaret was silent.</p>

<p>"Because, for the insignificant sum of two
cents, I would tell you," he went on.</p>

<p>"I haven't two cents with me," said Margaret.
"I think it is time to go home now,
Gerald."</p>

<p>"Generosity is part of my nature," said
Gerald; "I'll tell you for nothing. Margaret&mdash;sit
down, please!"</p>

<p>Margaret had risen to her feet. The words
had the old merry ring, but a deep note
quivered in his voice. The girl was afraid,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
she knew not of what; afraid, yet with a fear
that was half joy. "I&mdash;I must go, Gerald,
indeed!" she said, faintly.</p>

<p>"You must not go," said Gerald, gravely.
"It is not all play, Margaret, between you
and me. My cap and bells are off now, and
you must hear what I have to say."</p>

<p>Margaret, still hesitating, looked up in his
face, and saw something there that brought
the sweet color flooding over her neck and
brow, so swift and hot that instinctively she
hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>But gently, tenderly, Gerald Merryweather
drew the slender hands away, and held them
close in his own.</p>

<p>"My dearest girl," said the young man,
"my dearest love, you are not afraid of me?
Sit down by me; sit down, my Margaret, and
let me tell you what my heart has been saying
ever since the day I first saw you."</p>

<p>So dear Margaret sat down, perhaps because
she could hardly stand, and listened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
And the black cattle listened, too, and so did
the fish-hawk overhead, and the little birds
peeping from their nest in the birch wood
close at hand; but none of them ever told
what Gerald said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>THE SNOWY OWL</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I think</span> it is a horrid bother, if you want
to know!" said Willy.</p>

<p>"Willy Merryweather! aren't you ashamed
of yourself? I never heard anything so
odious, when we are all so happy, and everything
is so perfectly lovely. I don't see what
you mean."</p>

<p>"I don't care, it <i>is</i> a bother. Nothing is
the way it used to be; it's all nothing but
spooning, all over the lot."</p>

<p>"I should not think you would use vulgar
expressions, anyhow, Willy."</p>

<p>"'Spooning' isn't vulgar," said Willy,
sulkily. "I've heard Pa say it, so there!
And&mdash;look here, Kitty! Of course, it's all
corking, and so on, and anyhow, girls like that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
kind of fuss; but it does spoil everything, I
tell you. Why, Pa couldn't get a crew for
the war canoe yesterday. He wanted to go
to Pine Cove&mdash;at least I did, awfully, and
he said all right, so we would; and then
Jerry was off with Margaret in the <i>Keewaydin</i>,
and Bell and Jack were out in the woods
fiddling, and Peggy and Phil&mdash;I say, Kitty!
You don't suppose <i>they</i> are going to get
spoony, do you?"</p>

<p>Kitty looked very wise, and pursed her lips
and nodded her head with an air of deep
mystery.</p>

<p>"You don't!" repeated Willy, looking
aghast.</p>

<p>"Hush, Willy!" said Kitty. "Don't say
a word! don't breathe it to anybody! I hope&mdash;I
<i>think</i> they are!"</p>

<p>"What a mean, horrid shame!" cried Willy,
indignantly. "I do think it is disgusting."</p>

<p>His sister turned on him with flashing eyes.
"It is you that is the shame!" she cried. "It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
is you who ought to be ashamed, Willy. Do
you want poor Phil to be all alone when Jerry
is married? Do you know that twins sometimes
pine away and <i>die</i>, Willy Merryweather,
when the other of them dies?"</p>

<p>"Jerry isn't going to die," said Willy,
uncomfortably. "What nonsense you talk,
Kitty."</p>

<p>"Well, marries. I should think very likely
they would, then, if they didn't get married
themselves. I think you are perfectly heartless,
Willy. And dear Peggy, too, so nice and
jolly! and if she goes away back out West
<i>without</i> falling in love with Phil, we may
never, never see her again; and she has
promised me a puppy of the very next litter
Simmerimmeris has. So there!"</p>

<p>Willy was silent for a moment, kicking the
pebbles thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Do you think she is&mdash;that?" he asked
at length, shamefacedly.</p>

<p>"Of course I don't <i>know!</i>" said Kitty, judicially.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
"Of course very likely nothing is
positively decided yet; but I am sure she likes
him very, very much, and he takes her out
whenever he has a chance."</p>

<p>"There's nobody else for him to take out,"
put in Willy; "the others are all spoon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Willy, don't be tiresome! and just think!
if they should get married and go to live out
West, then you and I could both go out to see
them, and ride all the ponies, and punch the
cows, and have real lassoes, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The children were coming home through
the wood. Kitty's voice had gradually risen,
till now it was a shrill squeak of excitement;
but at this moment it broke off suddenly, for
there was a rustling of branches, and the next
moment Gertrude stood before them with
grave looks.</p>

<p>"My dear chicks," she said, "you must not
talk so loud. I was in the pine parlor, and
could not help hearing the last part of what
you were saying. And anyhow, I would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
talk about such things, if I were you. Suppose
Peggy had been with me! How do you think
she would have felt? Mammy would
not like to have you gossiping in this foolish
way."</p>

<p>The children hung their heads.</p>

<p>"Oh! Toots," said Kitty, "I am sorry! I
didn't realize that we were getting anywhere
near the house. We were only thinking&mdash;at
least I was&mdash;how lovely it would be if
Peggy and Phil should&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kitty dear, hush!" said Gertrude, decidedly.
"You would better not think, and
you certainly <i>must not</i> talk, about anything of
the kind. There are enough real love-affairs
to interest you, you little match-maker, without
your building castles in the air. Let
Peggy and Phil alone!"</p>

<p>"I should think there were!" said Willy.
"That's just what I was saying, Toots; it's
nothing but spooning, all over the place.
There's no fun anywhere; this wretched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
love-making spoils everything. <i>I</i> think it's
perfectly childish."</p>

<p>"Do you, Willy dear?" said his sister; and
her smile was very sweet as she laid her hand
on the boy's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. Here are the white perch rising
like a house afire, and I can't get a soul
to go with me. It was just the same yesterday,
and it's like that almost every day now."</p>

<p>"Oh, Willy! I'll go with you," cried Kitty,
eagerly. "Why didn't you tell me the perch
were rising? Let's come right along this minute.
Toots will help us with the boat, won't
you, Toots?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll help!" said the Snowy Owl.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the white boat was speeding
on her way to the fishing-ground, the
little rowers bending to their oars, chattering
merrily as they went.</p>

<p>"That's one comfort!" Willy was saying.
"We've got Toots. Nobody will get her away
from us."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should hope not," said Kitty. "There's
nobody good enough, in the first place; and
besides, of course somebody must stay with
Papa and Mamma."</p>

<p>"I suppose you will be grown up yourself
some day!" said Willy, gruffly.</p>

<p>"I shall be likely to marry very young,"
said Kitty, seriously. "I heard Aunt Anna
say so."</p>

<p>Gertrude stood on the wharf, looking after
the retreating boat. "Poor Willy!" she said,
with a smile; "it <i>is</i> hard on him!"</p>

<p>She looked around her. It was afternoon,
a still, golden day. The lake was as she loved
best to see it, a sheet of living crystal, here
deep blue, here glittering in gold and diamonds,
here giving back shades of crimson
and russet from the autumn woods that
crowded down to the water's edge. Far out,
her eye caught a white flash, the gleam of a
paddle; there was another, just at the bend of
the shore; and was that dark spot the prow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of a third canoe, moored in the fairy cove of
Birch Island? Gertrude smiled again, and
her smile said many things.</p>

<p>Presently she raised her arms above her
head, and brought them down slowly, with a
powerful gesture. "How good it would be to
fly!" she said, dreamily. "To fly away up
to the iceberg country, where the snowy owls
live!"</p>

<p>She stood for a long time silent, gazing out
over the shining water. At last she shook
herself with a little laugh, and turned away.
The white canoe, her own especial pet, was
lying on the wharf. She launched it carefully,
then taking her paddle, knelt down in
the bow. A few long, swift strokes, and the
canoe shot out over the lake, and rested like a
great white bird with folded wings, then
glided slowly on again. It was a pity there
was none to see, for the picture was a fair
one: the stately maiden kneeling, her golden
hair sweeping about her, her white arms rising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and falling slowly, rhythmically, in perfect
grace.</p>

<p>"Tu-whoo!" said the Snowy Owl.</p>

<p>But only the loon answered her.</p>
